       "\"\\nit is seeming fake\\ngetting filled too fast material is almost like paper\\nwaistband is not fullweird band see photo the monthly pack had 2 packets  i want to return the other pack one i have opened please reply\\ni got pampers pants on subsciption basis and as a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past i find this more reliable we have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter and most importantly in the morning the diaper does not emanate bad odour the pants are very easy to use and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered as a bonus diaper is prefolded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag\\nit is a great product material is soft so no rashes and no tension too\\nmagic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness\\nthe new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit closer to the babyâs body\\nflexible waist band that adapts to babyâs movements for a comfortable fit\\nbaby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your babyâs delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation\\nolder version withextra absorb channel was of very good qualitybut this new pack withair channel is of wrost quality and leaking after 23hrsvery much shocked by such product from pampers please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately\\npoor delivery few diapers were soiled with mud stains as you can see in the picture posted had to throw them away waste of hard earned money\\nthese new air diapers are not as durable as the previous ones cotton like threads hang out on the outside of the diaper even after using only for 4 hours\\ni know pg for their quality and have witnessed it over usage of this product for last 3 years for my kid the product on amazon is a counterfeit product it cant withhold the urine even for one and starts leaking the layers are quite thin and seems cheap you can best avoid this product and buy the other one listed with 48 as quantity i am also surprised to learn that package of 48 is more expensive than the one having 64 units amazing economies of scale\\nno sure if amazon takes any action on having vendors sell fake products on their platform\\nwe've been using this for two years but the latest released version is so bad that we need to change in the middle of the night otherwise it leaks sad to see a good brand ruining it's image and losing customers now i need to start over research on what's the next best brand pampers lost a customer forever\\nreally did not know that a prestigious company like pg can do this with its customers worse diapers ever used my baby has been crying since last two days and did not sleep well luckily i found that the moment we change the diaper she stops crying however just after a pee she agains starts feeling annoyed pls don't purchase it as company is selling rejected products in open market via amazon its may be due to large number of orders liquid starts flowing outside and inside it sticks to skin and causes irritation to baby rashes did not appear as we frequently change diapers and wash with wet wipes before need an investigation by pampers team to check how a rejected product came to market i repeat again donot buy this product\\nthese new pampers diapers are no doubt better than huggies in terms of durability as there is no leakage and holds for long hours even though it is much thinner however the material is pretty rough and i see red marks on my son's bum when i take off the diaper i never had this issue with huggies even though leakage was an issue and it tends to clump up and wet making my son uncomfortable at night unfortunately i bought a monthly pack otherwise i would have bought huggies and used both alternately\\nalthough am not a pampers favouring mommy i've used them extensively for my 6 months old especially when we had a major trip out of india these pampers were absolute beauties fit and quality wise super thin my baby could wear any dress over it frocks pants rompers anything and everything looked trim no trace of the diaper being seen from outside lasts overnight as well flat 1012 hours but now i've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now leaving marks on her thighs anyway it was a good time pampering my girl until she gets to the larger group\\nthe first one that i used for my son the urine seeped out of the diaper the diaper did not absorb am attaching pics of the same so that you can see that though the diaper is supposed to leak only if full this is not absorbing at all this pack is the new aloe lotion one never had this problem with the premium pack\\nit doesnât leak at all it is the best in class diaper for kids it doesnât give rashes and is very soft on skin\\neasy to use best brand in the market no leakage of any kind good for baby upto 5 kg of weight\\ni am buying papmers since 10 months from amazon but this time\\nthe quality is too worst seems duplicate as it is not  working as it should be started leaking up aftyer 2 hours\\nalso got skin infection under the diaper area\\naazon please take care of it\\ntoo annoyed this time\\ni have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best it's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 11 months old it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortablei always buy\\npampers diapers from amazon because it give great and best discount possible without any second thought go for it\\nthis product us amazeits absorbancy power is alsorbancy power is awesomeits leak proof its make baby comfortthere is no side affect if thisits veery soft\\nwhen i purchased without subscription the product was so good as quality and durability but in subscription the product was so worst and as quality truly bad my baby boy is suffering with rashes and every time itching the private part it is very painful to see him in this situation and durability was so worst\\ni have ordered it last this month and almost half count of one packet used can you please return it and back my money\\ni am going to order this product as normal way and unsubscribe the offer\\nthanks\\nramendra\\nit is good product  and material is alsoo too good  good quality product overall it is best product\\ni have a baby and i used many no of diapers for my child but in every night give me low results but when i used this diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep i love this product\\ntotally nice product by amazon with less market price\\nthere are mixed quantities in single pack some are thin and some are thick\\npampers made like that not a fake product\\nnow they changed the design\\nthough i have been using pampers for my kid since a long time  i have multiple complaints and suggestion for pg\\n1 the pants are not as absorbent as you try to advertise it\\n2 it's not leak proof everytime my kid sleeps sideways he ends up getting the bed wet \\n3 the spread is not even there is always a heavy concentration at one portion\\n4 it's not rash proof so this so called 'aloe vera' diaper is of no use\\neverytime i have a friend coming from the states  i hear one complaint over and over again  the diapers in india aren't that absorbent ofcourse they can't afford to carry a 50kgs bag only of diaper so with a lot of disappointment they switch to the diapers here only to find lil baby bums got a rash now\\nthe new pampers pants is thin compared to previous one and the durability is not good as it leaks in one wetting itself and previous one was very good in soaking and would not leaki really think that pampers should manufacture it's product like before if it wants to keep up the brand nameoverall its an okay product this time considering the fact that i have always bought pampers pants for my kid for the past three years\\nthe product was goodà the packaging was superb the the brand like pampers is always worth trusting overall it is best among all and i must recommend you to have a look on it ones\\nhave ordered these multiple times on amazon always got good ones except this last time i immediately noticed the difference but we were about to travel and were in dire need of diapers so i went ahead and used them they aren't that bad honestly speaking a high quality fake but the reduced absorption capacity and the constant dampness inside even after just 1 or 2 susus gives it away have been very satisfied with the originals which i got in the previous purchases didn't expect this from amazon and kudos to the maker of the duplicates if one didn't have familiarity with the original they won't be able to tell the difference\\nthis is the best diaper i have used in this price range it is soft very absorbing and leak proof don't leave it for too long\\nalso it would be very good and helpful if pampers provided a little disposable bags with the diaper not every indian has a grabage heap lying around outside their house or an open field or rich neighbour with a dog to toss the diaper to and putting the poop ridden germ carrying little sacks in a kitchen trash can and leaving it for a day at 47 48 degree celcius with other decomposing and exothermic garbage is not very hygienic\\nbelieve me during its disposal you run out of all your saved plastic bags kept in another big plastic bag hanging behind the kitchen door and that big bag being empty breaks your heart\\nearlier pampers was good  but this time it's not good baby is getting rashesh so as to check we brought premium one it gives best result as compared to this product\\nwant to return  not return want replace it to premium qaultiy but product is not under returnable policy it too bad\\nplease help me in this regard as i don't want amazon name to bad and stopping buying stuffs from online\\ni have used many diapers for baby but pampers are one of the best diapers  because its really soft and leak proof  it absorbency is really good as compared to other diapers it locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it  and there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies  this new upgraded version of the product is really good\\ngood product received on friday i have bought this for my nephew when i opened the packaging scent like smell came i am impressed by that and this diaper also absorb a lot without becoming heavy\\npampere all night diapers actually give comgfort for the whole night\\nthe diaper pants are easy to put on \\neasy to tear it while removing\\nalso it dosent leak at allthats the best part\\ni will prefer these pants over other brandsalso got it for a decent rate on amazon\\nthese new pampers babydry pants style diper i use it for my baby last all night without any leakages so i would definitely recommend them to all you will feel reassured that your baby isnât ever sleeping in wet sheets this pants diaper also hug the child's waistline and so stay in place nicely my baby did not have any skin reactions showing that this product is made of high quality materialsthis product has given my baby confidence which makes me happy my life is easier because we no longer have to deal with any skin reactions or rashes and my baby is comfortable i love that the pants are so easy to pull up and down requiring no effort at all thank u amazon fastest delivery and packing was also good\\nbrought this for my nephew\\ni have tried every brand of diaper and pampers is all i will ever buygood for the night time we have been using these for about 4 months on our 9 month old new  we use these at night  these are nice because they are more flexible then other brands they are ideal for sleep time i am extremely satisfied and we recommend this to everyone\\nand it has very fast delivery\\ni am buying this pampers for the last 2  year and the product was extremely good but this time i received a product with slightly different design and i thought they must have improved the design but to my disappointment the updated product is worst it leaked for consecutive 2 nights since i started using it and also the product quality is inferior never expected pampers to introduce a product without any trials now that i have purchased a 128 nos box i am left with no choice\\nit is a great product material is soft so no rashes and no tension too\\nmagic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness we haven't got any issues with leaking through my daughter is a heavy wetter and most importantly in the morning the diaper does not emanate bad odour the new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit closer to the babyâs body flexible waistband that adapts to babyâs movements for a comfortable fit highly recommended product\\nthe pampers are off pathetic quality as i am using the same in germany and they hold up through the day this one leak and has some perfumed coating when you pay a premium to get the best for your kid the quality surely disappoints any other diaper in the market does a better job\\nps not attaching any pictures as the pictures will be of a toddler's leaked diapers\\nthis isn't a genuine product because when i buy the same from a shop and use it my son sleeps through the night and the diapers dont leak but these diapers i purchased from amazon always leak within couple of hours n my son gets upwould have given zero stars if there was an option because my baby wakes up crying in his sleep when he wears them because of the wetness n leak which also runs our bedsheet\\nwhat i orderd that i was gettingpemper is the best company for baby pantpacking was gudproduct was nice\\ndiapers quality is good and comfortable for my baby very easy to use just wear them like a pant and at the time of removing it tear it from any side of the diaper baby is new born and its a fit and leak proof pants\\nthis is the first time i am trying pampers for my son it's definitely not up to the mark i am not even sure what i got was original\\ni got the product through subscription service provided by amazon it took 10 days to receive the product\\nthe diaper design and everything look similar to original product its really soft but absorbency level is very low we have change the diaper mid of the night to avoid leakage\\ngreat for both baby's and mother's sleep\\nthis product is very helpful for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both  i got this from amazon at very low cost  it has around 20 units  each consists of air channels which provides  dryness whole night  highly comfortable and fit  it has flexible waist that adapts to babyâs movements  each unit has aloe vera lotion that protects babyâs delicate skin from rashes and irritation  overall quality is too good  i got this delivered in just within 23 days  it was nicely packed and properly sealed \\nit is not at all soft left my kid with rashes all around it is not leak proof too pampers of perhaps different sku was used earlier from the local market and it was absolutely fantastic but the one bought from amazon was totally shitty one i was so desonant seeing rashes all around my kid also the size of both was m but the one bought from amazon was smaller than the one bought from market we have stopprd using it long back and now the m size from market is perfect so i would not even give 1 in rating to this product\\nrecently i picked these up and they are wonderful i wouldn't have thought before i was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praisethey are soft very absorbent and fits greatthese diapers provide up to 12 hours of leakproof protection  are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortabletotally love these diapers\\n1 small size is for babies whors weight is around 58 kgs\\n2 20 daipers would be there inside the pack\\n3 one daipers will easily go for entire one night as absorption is very good of pampers daipers\\n4 it's fragrance is very good it smells like jhonsons powder you would love it\\n5 you won't feel like he has done toilet inside because of the wonderful smell\\n6 it contains aloe vera also in those daipers which will prevent baby skin from rashes and bad smell\\nwhen to change\\nif you made your baby wear a daiepr in the night change it in the morning you will start feeling the daipers to be quite heavy then you'll understand its time tk change the daipers\\nprecaution\\ndon't make your baby wear the same daipers for entire one day else it can cause health issue and rashes etc on baby skin as baby skin is very sensitive\\npros\\n1 buying diaeprs online is a good option as you can find offers and discount while buying daipers online rather then buying it rate to rate on any medical store\\npampers pants diapers is the only product i trust and use for my baby in terms of comfort the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free the 3 extra absorb channels the best feature of this diaper style has ensured that i never had the problem of leaks and unnecessary changes during the nights or on long journeys the style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks\\nin terms of pricing i found that the online offers on amazon are more suitable and cost saving when compared to buying from the actual store\\ni strongly recommend the pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and moneyi have heard of pampers even before i was a mother ever since my baby was born i have used pampers diapers for him its extremely soft for the baby skin\\noverall using pampers diapers have been a great experience for me i have been pampering my baby with pampers diapers  \\nworst diapers ever purchased every single piece is leaking gives protection only for 3 hours can not use this for full night in morning you will find your bedding wet because the diaper has leaked whole night trust me dont go by fake reviews this is the worst diaper  probably duplicate quite possible\\nthis monthly box comes in two sets 76 pants each unlike 4 sets earlier that wasn't a problem but now i feel the capacity of the pants has considerably reduced unlike before the pants get full within 5 hours on most occassions  hence it has been a bit difficult specially during the night hours my kid weighs 115kgs  to use large diapers would be loose this issue would be of concern more during winters when you don't want your kid to leak into the clothes\\notherwise there aren't any issues\\nworst diaper ever my baby is 3 months old i used only 5 diapers of this pack i use 1 diaper in a day for 4 hrs rest of the time i prefer to keep my baby in cloth nappy\\nthis diaper is not comfortable to my baby baby always cry or fussy after wearing this it gives alot heat inside my baby got red rashes that too i m using only for 4 hrs in a day\\ni stopped using it my packet got waste\\nthe diaper so called brand\\ntotally weste of money\\nthis one compare to some other unknown diaper  brands\\nthis can't be more than 2 hour's max\\nand other local i would say unknown diaper brands can as long as 6 to 7 hors \\ni've tried both one by one\\nand i found other diaper far better than this one\\nso called brands my foot\\ni'm doing mercy on them to give one star\\nit is a great product material is soft so no rashes and no tension too\\nmagic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness\\nthe new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit closer to the babyâs body\\nflexible waist band that adapts to babyâs movements for a comfortable fit\\nbaby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your babyâs delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation\\nðÿyeah it's ultra soft\\nðÿhave used huggies and premium diaper of pampers\\nðÿðÿðÿðÿwhen compared to itthis have a least absorbing power\\nðÿtoo high price mummy poko pants diapers are less priced compared to this\\nðÿit's not a good absorbent\\nðÿuse premium pampers instead of this dz is not that good\\nðÿðÿðÿhuggies are good absorbent than this but it is too heavy when peed\\nðÿnot fully satisfied\\nðÿu r paying money and try other brands too\\nðÿgot it for 679inr\\nðÿnext time will try mummy poko pants\\nðÿnot highly recommended\\nthis diaper is like a tissue paper and even damages also  my son as  did a twice a toilet in it but toilet starts coming out of ithe is 1 12 year old this type of diapers are providing in the amazon then you people will say our product is very good you people will say that with 3 to 5 working days amount will be refunded but we should wait for more than 15 to 20 days for our amount you people are very great in misguiding the customers\\nfirst off every child is different and every child has different reactions to diapers all 3 of my children have been in pampers no diaper rash medicine ever needed my oldest

have never used any cloth diaper for my son although i bought quite a lot of them in anticipation of rashes due to disposable diapers my son is 28 years now and except for a single episode of diaper rash he never had any diaper rash or any other discomfort i would advise all the new moms to go for these blindly the quality will ensure that the soft skin of your baby is safe and the fact that they are disposable will save you from all the extra work and discomfort that comes with the use of cloth diapers\\nyour recently viewed items and featured recommendationsyour recently viewed items and

quick delivery\\nthe pads comes with nice quality inthe pack i got 20 count with long durability about 8 hours max\\nit is easy to wear and weight up to 10 kgs of baby not more than that\\nthis pads gives the exact fit and keeps the child comfortable\\nthe alovera gel helps the baby from diaper rash and irritation\\nit comes with leakproof and  absorbency period upto 8 hours\\nkeeps the baby skin smooth without irritation useful for long nights \\ni used both normal diapers  pants for my new born baby normal diapers are way too good  cottony soft but these pants are a piece of plastic  the elastic on the pants gave elastic marks on my babyâs tummy i donât recommend using pants also pants are way lesser price than diapers i bought pants  after observing this i just threw them away although itâs a wastage of money\\nwe used pampers with our first child with excellent results we changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money she started having yeast infection rashes and woke up fussing nightly medical treatment did not resolve symptoms about 1 month into the switch we realized that her symptoms started after the diaper swap within 1 week of returning to pampers we stopped topical treatment secondary to symptom resolution she has been symptom free since we should've have tried to cut the corner best of luck with your choice\\nthere is literally nothing better than this product in the market this product is the standard and it does set high ones too having tried all kinds of brands of diapers i can confidently tell you pampers is the best huggies and libero were good when your little one is really tiny but pampers takes care of toddlers the best the gusset fits perfectly and never leaks unless you have left on the diaper for a longer time or if you have taken a wrong size undersize or oversized yes i learnt this the hard way ðÿ\\nso always take according to baby's weight\\nthis product pampers is really good i order this product for my daughter she is approx 2months old and i was worried about wheather she got rashes or itching or she wear it or not but the quality of material is good and soft and it fit perfectly the size of dipper is not so bulky so that u can also put a underwear over it she wear it approx 6 to 7 hours and pee lots of time but there is no leakage the magic gel is too good even she didnot get any rashes also i hear lot of time wearing a dipper for kids is not good thing in summer but they are wrong thanks for pampers\\ni disappointed with pampers as i not expected this type of cheap quality diaper pants it leaks frequently its not absorb efficiently so my child feel irritation and have rashes on skin its not at all soft material is so cheap\\npampers are all time fav to moms pampers pants diapers is the only product i trust and use for my baby in terms of comfort the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free the 3 extra absorb channels the style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks\\ni strongly recommend the pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and moneyi have heard\\noverall using pampers diapers have been a great experience for me i have been pampering my baby with pampers diapers  \\nit is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes it also has great absorbency power and lasts all night doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have\\ni purchased it for my nephewsthe quality was good nd absorb easily\\nthe quality of the product received was very poor it started leaking after 4 hours i have being using this diaper for my kid since a year but this time the product was very poor i think its a fake product i had received  this type of fake product 3 months ago again this time same experience this was not expected from pampers\\nprice is very low other market s high\\nit is a great product material is soft so no rashes and no tension too\\nmagic gel that locks wetness away for up to 5 hours of dryness\\nthe new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit closer to the babyâs body\\nflexible waist band that adapts to babyâs movements for a comfortable fit\\nbaby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your babyâs delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation\\nseriously unhappy with amazon because we placed an order for pampers large  due to the worst quality of the diaper  we tried to return the product they told it can't be returned so they assured me that they will provide me a return less refund but it is still pending called 2 times and they assured it has processed from their end and the refund reference number is 000601 i'm going to display the same message and share with my friends who constantly purchase from amazon its not about money but every month i purchase still a very bad follow up\\npampers products are really harsh on my babyâs skin it leaves marks all around the diaper area which is very concerning i neglected peopleâs opinion regarding the product but now thinking should have gone through it product is durable super thin  everything is good but the only problem is it is horrible on babyâs skin i will never ever compromise on my baby for this matter\\ni've been using pampers for my baby for a long time known for keeping the wetness away this has been my go to brand\\nwith the new air channels being introduced the wetness us absorbed and allows flow of fresh air onto baby skin the aloe lotion keeps the skin soft the expandable waist band makes it easy for the baby to wear overall the baby bum stays dry the whole night it's leakproof and cotton like softness is one of the reasons pampers is a trusted brand\\ngiving pamper to your baby is just like totally pampering to the child no rash no itching no spots no dark shading to skin etc its like total care of using pamper diaper even though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all it good to use pamper said to all mom\\npampers is very trusted brand and diapers are best in this range me and my wife always worried about the baby hygiene and cleanliness and always think of product which will give protection to kids and are safe this diapers are great in this matter and always give complete protection to babies and this diapers lock the wetness inside which makes the baby comfortable and diapers can be used comfotably the size is exactly good for carrying in travelling in travelling its very good to use\\nnothing is more important than the comfort of little baby these diaper pants keep baby comfortable in the day as well as in night cottony soft material is gentle on babyâs skin keeping their precious skin perfect good absorbing power observed used it for 8 hours or more really good product best diapers at best priceâ\\xa0\\nit is the 100 original product from amazon there is no any problem of rashes at all\\njust go for iti am sure you will not be unsatisfied with this product\\nand thanks amazon for quick delivery\\nit is a great product material is soft so no rashes and no tension too\\nmagic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness\\nthe new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit closer to the babyâs body\\nflexible waist band that adapts to babyâs movements for a comfortable fit\\ni have purchased pampers diapers online first time i was worried about the\\nproduct quality but after getting the product in hand i am totally\\nsatisfied i can tell you all that the product is genuine because last one year i have purchased diaper from various local shops and i know the original product quality i am very happy with it and i am surely buy\\npampers diapers from amazon next in future it gives comfort to my child and me as it is leak proof and easy to use\\ni have used pampers earlier it's a trustworthy brand but don't know what happened this time i bought the monthly box within half an hour of usage my baby had severe rashes redness and itching in the diaper area terrible it is worst part they can't be returned also my whole money got wasted each and every diaper of the box gave itching to my baby so had to throw all in the dustbin\\nthe fit of these diapers runs on the smaller side compared to other brands which may mean you have to experiment before landing on the right side or size up more quickly than youâd expect âœto avoid poop blowouts purchase the next size upâ noted one mom that said for smaller babies the close fit is perfect\\nbaby is getting rashes and after urination the diaper is like very warm as in luke warm water hotness and it stays that way for 1520 mins even after removing it  i have used pampers when bought from medical shop and never faced this  somehow feels like of it's chemical reaction or something my baby is getting little bit of rashes also the diaper itself feels more paperish than the pampers i got from medical shop i have used pampers from the time my baby is small but this is experience is weird \\nthese new pampers  diapers are no doubt better than other buggies in terms of durability i know about the pg product and their  quality and baby feel comfortable while wearing it and packaging  is hygiene  and there is no issue of leaking and also too soft for baby  pampers pent diapers  also fit to the baby\\nlotion with aloe vera is really nice  which help to protect child skin tooðÿ it's cotton is very soft magic gel with light  dry too best pampers for new born child go  buy now\\nproduct quality is too good  i'm using pampers for the very first day for my son he enjoys in pamper pant   he is wearing diaper a most of the day and dosen't get rash but from the other brands pampers are very genuine product  super comfy  great absorbency  over all i'm totally satisfied with pampers and should recommend to the other moms  happy motherhood  u can easily trust this brand for your newborns too  i have no complaint till now\""

only for 4 hours', \"although am not a pampers favouring mommy i've used them extensively for my 6 months old especially when we had a major trip out of india these pampers were absolute beauties fit and quality wise super thin my baby could wear any dress over it frocks pants rompers anything and everything looked trim no trace of the diaper being seen from outside lasts overnight as well flat 1012 hours but now i've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now leaving marks on her thighs anyway it was a good time pampering my girl until she gets to the larger group\", 'the first one that i used for my son the urine seeped out of the diaper the diaper did not absorb am attaching pics of the same so that you can see that though the diaper is supposed to leak only if full this is not absorbing at all this pack is the new aloe lotion one never had this problem with the premium pack', 'it doesnât leak at all it is the best in class diaper for kids it doesnât give rashes and is very soft on skin', 'i have a baby and i used many no of diapers for my child but in every night give me low results but when i used this diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep i love this product', \"this is the best diaper i have used in this price range it is soft very absorbing and leak proof don't leave it for too long\", 'also it would be very good and helpful if pampers provided a little disposable bags with the diaper not every indian has a grabage heap lying around outside their house or an open field or rich neighbour with a dog to toss the diaper to and putting the poop ridden germ carrying little sacks in a kitchen trash can and leaving it for a day at 47 48 degree celcius with other decomposing and exothermic garbage is not very hygienic', \"i have used many diapers for baby but pampers are one of the best diapers  because its really soft and leak proof  it absorbency is really good as compared to other diapers it locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it  and there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies  this new upgraded version of the product is really good\", 'good product received on friday i have bought this for my nephew when i opened the packaging scent like smell came i am impressed by that and this diaper also absorb a lot without becoming heavy', 'the diaper pants are easy to put on ', 'the pampers are off pathetic quality as i am using the same in germany and they hold up through the day this one leak and has some perfumed coating when you pay a premium to get the best for your kid the quality surely disappoints any other diaper in the market does a better job', \"recently i picked these up and they are wonderful i wouldn't have thought before i was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praisethey are soft very absorbent and fits greatthese diapers provide up to 12 hours of leakproof protection  are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortabletotally love these diapers\", 'pampers pants diapers is the only product i trust and use for my baby in terms of comfort the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free the 3 extra absorb channels the best feature of this diaper style has ensured that i never had the problem of leaks and unnecessary changes during the nights or on long journeys the style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks', 'i strongly recommend the pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and moneyi have heard of pampers even before i was a mother ever since my baby was born i have used pampers diapers for him its extremely soft for the baby skin', 'this diaper is not comfortable to my baby baby always cry or fussy after wearing this it gives alot heat inside my baby got red rashes that too i m using only for 4 hrs in a day', 'the diaper so called brand', 'and i found other diaper far better than this one', 'pampers have been my first choice as a diaper brand i have been used pampers for my first child also and after 6 years now using again for my newly born baby', 'i always find pampers diapers super comfortable leak proof with great absorbency now as my baby has started crawling i had tried pampers pants and again i am a happy customer main point is that my baby got no diaper rashes till date with pampers hoping to continue the friendship with pampers intact', 'material quality is good for skin but the diapers absorbing material is so thin that u have to change it after 34 hrs you cannot rely on single diaper for whole night i ordered other pampers diapers but this is worst no option for return', \"says small size 5 to 8kg but size is suitable for newborn to max 6kg my baby weighs 4kg and it's jus right for her when i remove the diaper there are impressions of diaper elastic on tummy and thighs outer portion feels wet wen i pick up d babyhave used pampers tape style newborn baby diapers n really liked themtry d size with a smaller packet first before ordering i ordered pack of 72 and now it's tight for my baby\", 'since a good fit is important for comfort and leak prevention i like that diaper material is elastic and pleating around the leg edges', 'clearly the best diapers available in the indian market i tried other brands also when my son was born but quickly realised that none of them matches the quality and softness of pampers have been using pampers ever since i have never used any cloth diaper for my son although i bought quite a lot of them in anticipation of rashes due to disposable diapers my son is 28 years now and except for a single episode of diaper rash he never had any diaper rash or any other discomfort i would advise all the new moms to go for these blindly the quality will ensure that the soft skin of your baby is safe and the fact that they are disposable will save you from all the extra work and discomfort that comes with the use of cloth diapers', 'the alovera gel helps the baby from diaper rash and irritation', 'i strongly recommend the pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and moneyi have heard', 'the quality of the product received was very poor it started leaking after 4 hours i have being using this diaper for my kid since a year but this time the product was very poor i think its a fake product i had received  this type of fake product 3 months ago again this time same experience this was not expected from pampers', 'pampers products are really harsh on my babyâs skin it leaves marks all around the diaper area which is very concerning i neglected peopleâs opinion regarding the product but now thinking should have gone through it product is durable super thin  everything is good but the only problem is it is horrible on babyâs skin i will never ever compromise on my baby for this matter', \"giving pamper to your baby is just like totally pampering to the child no rash no itching no spots no dark shading to skin etc its like total care of using pamper diaper even though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all it good to use pamper said to all mom\", \"baby is getting rashes and after urination the diaper is like very warm as in luke warm water hotness and it stays that way for 1520 mins even after removing it  i have used pampers when bought from medical shop and never faced this  somehow feels like of it's chemical reaction or something my baby is getting little bit of rashes also the diaper itself feels more paperish than the pampers i got from medical shop i have used pampers from the time my baby is

trusted brand\", 'pampers is very trusted brand and diapers are best in this range me and my wife always worried about the baby hygiene and cleanliness and always think of product which will give
