# Review-Classification-using-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a test project to understand various web scraping techniques and various Natual Language Processing Tools under the guidance of Prof. Amitabha Acharya.
We extracted reviews for products using python web scraping tools. We developed scraper for amazon product reviews and flipkart product reviews. We applied various NLP( NLTK ) tools to extract relevant features. We then try to find out whether the feature is marked positive or negative using sentiment analysis of the reviews.
