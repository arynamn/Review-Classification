Review
It is seeming fake.
getting filled too fast. material is almost like paper.
waistband is not full..weird band. see photo. the monthly pack had 2 packets.  I want to return the other pack. one I have opened.. please reply
"I got Pampers pants on subsciption basis, and as a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past, I find this more reliable. We have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was of very good quality....but this new pack with""AIR CHANNEL"" is of wrost quality and leaking after 2-3hrs....very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately."
Poor delivery. Few diapers were soiled with mud stains as you can see in the picture posted. Had to throw them away. Waste of hard earned money.
"These new ""air"" diapers are not as durable as the previous ones. Cotton like threads hang out on the outside of the diaper even after using only for 4 hours."
"I know P&G for their quality, and have witnessed it over usage of this product for last 3 years for my Kid. The product on Amazon is a counterfeit product, it cant withhold the urine even for one and starts leaking. The layers are quite thin and seems cheap. You can best avoid this product and buy the other one listed with 48 as quantity. I am also surprised to learn that package of 48 is more expensive than the one having 64 units. Amazing economies of scale."
No sure if Amazon takes any action on having vendors sell fake products on their platform.
"We've been using this for two years. But the latest released version is so bad that we need to change in the middle of the night, otherwise it leaks. Sad to see a good brand ruining it's image and losing customers. Now I need to start over research on what's the next best brand. Pampers lost a customer, forever."
Really did not know that a prestigious company like P&G can do this with its customers... Worse diapers ever used... My baby has been crying since last two days and did not sleep well... Luckily i found that the moment we change the diaper she stops crying however just after a pee she agains starts feeling annoyed... Pls don't purchase it as company is selling rejected products in open market via amazon... Its may be due to large number of orders. Liquid starts flowing outside and inside. It sticks to skin and causes irritation to baby... Rashes did not appear as we frequently change diapers and wash with wet wipes before... Need an investigation by pampers team to check how a rejected product came to market... I repeat again... DONOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...
"These new pampers diapers are no doubt better than huggies in terms of durability. As there is no leakage and holds for long hours, even though it is much thinner. However, the material is pretty rough and I see red marks on my son's bum when I take off the diaper. I never had this issue with huggies even though leakage was an issue and it tends to clump up and wet making my son uncomfortable at night. Unfortunately i bought a monthly pack otherwise I would have bought huggies and used both alternately."
"Although am not a pampers favouring mommy, I've used them extensively for my 6 months old, especially when we had a major trip out of India. These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours. But now I've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now, leaving marks on her thighs. Anyway, it was a good time pampering my girl, until she gets to the larger group."
"The first one that I used for my son. The urine seeped out of the diaper. The diaper did not absorb. Am attaching pics of the same so that you can see that though the diaper is supposed to leak only if full, this is not absorbing at all. This pack is the new aloe lotion one. Never had this problem with the premium pack"
It doesn’t leak at all. It is the best in class Diaper for kids. It doesn’t give rashes and is very soft on skin.
Easy to use. Best brand in the market. No leakage of any kind. Good for baby upto 5 kg of weight.
I am buying Papmers since 10 months from Amazon but this time
the quality is too worst seems duplicate as it is not  working as it should be started leaking up aftyer 2 hours
also got skin infection under the diaper area
Aazon please take care of it
Too annoyed this time
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 11 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable..I always buy"
Pampers diapers from Amazon because it give great and best discount possible.. without any second thought go for it.
This product us amaze.its absorbancy power is alsorbancy power is awesome...its leak proof. its make baby comfort.there is no side affect if this.its veery soft..
it is good product  and material is alsoo too good .. good quality product.. overall it is best product.
"When I purchased without subscription, the product was so good as quality and Durability. But In subscription the product was so worst and as quality truly bad. My baby boy is suffering with rashes and every time itching the private part. It is very painful to see him in this situation and durability was so worst."
I have ordered it last this month and almost half count of one packet used. Can you please return it and back my money.
I am going to order this product as normal way and unsubscribe the offer.
Thanks
Ramendra
I have a baby and I used many no of diapers for my child but in every night give me low results but when I used this diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep ...I love this product
Totally nice Product By amazon With Less market Price
There are mixed quantities in single pack. Some are thin and some are thick.
Pampers made like that. Not a fake product.
Now they changed the design.
Though I have been using Pampers for my kid since a long time - I have multiple complaints and suggestion for P&G.
1. The pants are not as absorbent as you try to advertise it.
"2. It's not leak proof. Everytime my kid sleeps sideways, he ends up getting the bed wet :(."
3. The spread is not even. There is always a heavy concentration at one portion.
4. It's not rash proof. So this so called 'Aloe Vera' diaper is of no use.
Everytime I have a friend coming from The States - I hear one complaint over and over again - the diapers in India aren't that absorbent. Ofcourse they can't afford to carry a 50kgs bag only of diaper so with a lot of disappointment they switch to the diapers here only to find lil baby bums got a rash now.
The new Pampers pants is thin compared to previous one and the durability is not good as it leaks in one wetting itself and previous one was very good in soaking and would not leak...I really think that Pampers should manufacture it's product like before if it wants to keep up the brand name...overall its an okay product this time considering the fact that I have always bought Pampers pants for my kid for the past three years.
The product was good। The packaging was superb. The the brand like pampers is always worth trusting overall it is best among all and I must recommend you to have a look on it ones
"Have ordered these multiple times on amazon. Always got good ones, except this last time. I immediately noticed the difference, but we were about to travel and were in dire need of diapers. So I went ahead and used them. They aren't that bad honestly speaking. A high quality fake, but the reduced absorption capacity and the constant dampness inside even after just 1 or 2 susus gives it away. Have been very satisfied with the originals which I got in the previous purchases. Didn't expect this from amazon. And kudos to the maker of the duplicates! If one didn't have familiarity with the original, they won't be able to tell the difference!"
"This is the best diaper i have used in this price range. It is soft, very absorbing and leak proof (don't leave it for too long)."
"Also it would be very good and helpful if pampers provided a little disposable bags with the diaper. Not every Indian has a grabage heap lying around outside their house, or an open field, or rich neighbour with a dog to toss the diaper to and putting the poop ridden, germ carrying little sacks in a kitchen trash can and leaving it for a day at 47 48 degree celcius with other decomposing and exothermic garbage is not very hygienic."
"Believe me, during its disposal, you run out of all your saved plastic bags kept in another big plastic bag hanging behind the kitchen door and that big bag being empty, breaks your heart."
Earlier pampers was good..  but this time it's not good... Baby is getting rashesh... So as to check we brought premium one... It gives best result as compared to this product....
Want to return .. not return want replace it to premium qaultiy... But product is not under returnable policy... It too bad.....
Please help me in this regard as I don't want Amazon name to bad and stopping buying stuffs from online..
I have used many diapers for baby but pampers are one of the best diapers.  Because its really soft and leak proof.  It absorbency is really good as compared to other diapers. It locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it.  And there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies.  This new upgraded version of the product is really good.
Good product received on friday. I have bought this for my nephew. When i opened the packaging scent like smell came i am impressed by that and this diaper also absorb a lot without becoming heavy.
Pampere all night diapers actually give comgfort for the whole night.
The diaper pants are easy to put on .
Easy to tear it while removing.
Also it Dosent leak at all..thats the best part.
I will prefer these pants over other brands..also got it for a decent rate on amazon.
"These New Pampers Baby-Dry pants style diper I use it for my baby last all night without any leakages, so I would definitely recommend them to all. You will feel reassured that your baby isn’t ever sleeping in wet sheets. This pants diaper also hug the child's waistline and so stay in place nicely. My baby did not have any skin reactions, showing that this product is made of high quality materials.This product has given my baby confidence, which makes me happy. My life is easier because we no longer have to deal with any skin reactions or rashes and my baby is comfortable. I love that the pants are so easy to pull up and down, requiring no effort at all. Thank u Amazon fastest delivery and packing was also good."
Brought this for my nephew
I have tried every brand of diaper and pampers is all I will ever buyGood for the night time We have been using these for about 4 months on our 9 month old new . We use these at night . These are nice because they are more flexible then other brands they are ideal for sleep time I am extremely satisfied and we recommend this to everyone.
And it has very fast delivery
"I am buying this Pampers for the last 2  year and the product was extremely good, but this time, I received a product with slightly different design and I thought they must have improved the design. But to my disappointment, the updated product is worst. It leaked for consecutive 2 nights since I started using it. And also the product quality is inferior. Never expected Pampers to introduce a product without any trials. Now that I have purchased a 128 nos box, I am left with no choice."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
"Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness. We haven't got any issues with leaking through my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body Flexible waistband that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit. highly recommended product."
"The pampers are off pathetic quality as I am using the same in Germany and they hold up through the day, This one leak and has some perfumed coating. When you pay a premium to get the best for your kid, the quality surely disappoints. Any other diaper in the market does a better job."
P.S not attaching any pictures as the pictures will be of a toddler's leaked diapers.
This isn't a genuine product because when I buy the same from a shop and use it my son sleeps through the night and the diapers dont leak but these diapers I purchased from Amazon always leak within couple of hours n my son gets up...would have given zero stars if there was an option because my baby wakes up crying in his sleep when he wears them because of the wetness n leak which also runs our bedsheet
What i orderd that i was getting.pemper is the best company for baby pant.packing was gud.product was nice.
Diapers quality is good and comfortable for my baby. Very easy to use just wear them like a pant and at the time of removing it tear it from any side of the diaper. Baby is new born and its a fit and leak proof pants.
This is the first time I am trying pampers for my son.. it's definitely not up to the mark.. I am not even sure what I got was original..
I got the product through subscription service provided by Amazon.. it took 10 days to receive the product..
The diaper design and everything look similar to original product.. its really soft... but absorbency level is very low.. we have change the diaper mid of the night to avoid leakage..
Great for both baby's and mother's sleep..
"This product is very helpful for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 20 units , each consists of air channels which provides  dryness whole night . Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good . I got this delivered in just within 2-3 days . It was nicely packed and properly sealed ."
It is not at all soft. Left my kid with rashes all around. It is not leak proof too. Pampers of perhaps different sku was used earlier from the local market and it was absolutely fantastic. But the one bought from Amazon was totally shitty one. I was so desonant seeing rashes all around my kid. Also the size of both was M. But the one bought from amazon was smaller than the one bought from market. We have stopprd using it long back and now the M size from market is perfect. So i would not even give 1 in rating to this product.
"Recently I picked these up and they are wonderful! I wouldn't have thought before I was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praise.They are soft, very absorbent and fits great.These diapers provide up to 12 hours of leak-proof protection & are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortable.Totally love these diapers"
1) small size is for babies whors weight is around 5-8 kgs
2) 20 daipers would be there inside the pack
"3) one daipers will easily go for entire one night, as absorption is very good of pampers daipers"
"4) it's fragrance is very good, it smells like jhonsons powder, you would love it"
5) you won't feel like he has done toilet inside because of the wonderful smell
6) it contains aloe vera also in those daipers which will prevent baby skin from rashes and bad smell
When to change-
"If you made your baby wear a daiepr in the night, change it in the morning. You will start feeling the daipers to be quite heavy then you'll understand its time tk change the daipers"
Precaution:
"Don't make your baby wear the same daipers for entire one day, else it can cause health issue and rashes etc on baby skin, as baby skin is very sensitive"
Pros:
"1) buying diaeprs online is a good option as you can find offers and discount while buying daipers online, rather then buying it rate to rate on any medical store"
"Nothing to say again about this brand. As always very premium brand and product is very good for baby. No lickage, also get a great discount with faster delivery."
"Pampers pants diapers is the only product I trust and use for my baby. In terms of comfort, the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free. The 3 extra absorb channels, the best feature of this diaper style has ensured that I never had the problem of leaks and unnecessary changes during the nights or on long journeys. The style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks."
"In terms of pricing, I found that the online offers on amazon are more suitable and cost saving when compared to buying from the actual store."
I strongly recommend the Pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and money.I have heard of pampers even before I was a mother. Ever since my baby was born I have used pampers diapers for him. Its extremely soft for the baby skin.
Overall using Pampers Diapers have been a great experience for me. I have been Pampering my baby with Pampers diapers :) :)
"Worst Diapers Ever Purchased. Every single piece is leaking. Gives protection only for 3 hours. Can not use this for full night. In morning you will find your bedding wet because the diaper has leaked whole night. Trust me, dont go by fake reviews. This is the worst diaper . Probably duplicate, quite possible."
This monthly box comes in two sets (76 pants each) unlike 4 sets earlier. That wasn't a problem but now I feel the capacity of the pants has considerably reduced unlike before. The pants get full within 5 hours on most occassions & hence it has been a bit difficult specially during the night hours. My kid weighs 11.5kgs & to use Large diapers would be loose. This issue would be of concern more during winters when you don't want your kid to leak into the clothes.
"Otherwise, there aren't any issues."
"Worst Diaper ever, my baby is 3 months old.. i used only 5 diapers of this pack.. i use 1 diaper in a day for 4 hrs.... Rest of the time i prefer to keep my baby in cloth nappy."
This diaper is not comfortable to my baby... Baby always cry or fussy after wearing this.. it gives alot heat inside... My baby got red rashes that too i m using only for 4 hrs in a day..
I stopped using it... My packet got waste.
The diaper so called brand
Totally weste of money
This one compare to some other unknown diaper  brands.
This can't be more than 2 hour's max.
And other local I would say unknown diaper brands can as long as 6 to 7 hors .
I've tried both one by one.
And I found other diaper far better than this one.
So called brands. My foot.
I'm doing mercy on them to give one star.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation

"This diaper is like a tissue paper and even damages also  ,my son as  did a twice a toilet in it but toilet starts coming out of it,he is 1 1/2 year old. This type of Diapers are providing in the Amazon ,then you people will say ""Our product is very good"".. You people will say that with 3 to 5 working days amount will be refunded ,but we should wait for more than 15 to 20 days for our amount ,you people are very great in misguiding the customers."
"First off, every child is different and every child has different reactions to diapers. All 3 of my children have been in Pampers. No diaper rash medicine ever needed. My oldest two I put in Luvs when they got older. Around 2. My youngest is just now turning 2 and he will be sticking with Pampers. With every brand of diaper I have tried with him he had leaked through except pampers. All my children have gotten rashes from Huggies. But I don't blame them, there is just something in them that don't agree with my children. I know a lot of people think that when buying Pampers you're paying more for the name, but in my case it has been the best. So as a caution. If your child gets a bad diaper rash and your not sure why, change your brand. Very poor quality. One pack menses 56 pants...pack inner 52 paints diapers"
I have always ordered diapers from Amazon but this time I hv received pathetic quality. Pampers hv always maintained there quality standards but I think there is some glitch. Diapers are DUPLICATE. Diapers hv granules kind of a thing in them which seals the flow in gel form but these diapers are very thin. Completely disappointed from this time..

Very light weight. And soaks very much compared to other brands. Soft material. Easy to wear and easy to tear. Fulfill what it claims. 1 pampers = 1 dry and peaceful night.
"Pampers have been my first choice as a diaper brand. I have been used Pampers for my first child also, and after 6 years now using again for my newly born baby."
"I always find Pampers diapers super comfortable, leak proof, with great absorbency. Now, as my baby has started crawling, I had tried Pampers pants, and again I am a happy customer. Main point is that my baby got no diaper rashes till date with pampers. Hoping to continue the friendship with Pampers intact."
I had this brought this product for my little one. It's quite good can be used upto 5 to 6hours. It's leak free. It's very comfortable for the baby I am using it at night. The material is quite good and my baby sleeps well at night when he wears Pampers. It's leak proof and soft for new born babies.
"Material quality is good for skin but the diapers absorbing material is so thin that u have to change it after 3-4 hrs. You cannot rely on single diaper for whole night. I ordered other pampers diapers, but this is worst. No option for return..."
"Pampers are so soft, baby is comfortable after wearing it whole night. We get 20 count pack. Leak proof as i mention worked whole night. No rashes after using pampers."
Delivered on time
Packaging was good
It is very usefull product for all babies. High quality and no leakage at all. Go for it if you are looking for leak proof and soft diapers for babies
"Says small size 5 to 8kg, but size is suitable for newborn to max 6kg, my baby weighs 4kg, and it's jus right for her. When I remove the diaper there are impressions of diaper elastic on tummy and thighs. Outer portion feels wet wen I pick up d baby..have used pampers tape style newborn baby diapers n really liked them..try d size with a smaller packet first before ordering, I ordered pack of 72 and now it's tight for my baby"
I am sharing my experience of the very product after using it for my  11 months old baby daughter.
1) First of all the price is really cheap when compared to offline stores.
2) Genuine product with recently manufactured date is really appealing
3) Provide enough comfort for babies so that it won't disturb their sleep at night.
4) For my 11 months old baby single diaper is staying for at least 4 to 5 hours in day time.
5) The fabric is really smooth and doesn't cause any rashes.
"6)  Once the diaper gets filled, it can start to leak."
7) Overall value for money product.

"When it comes to diapers, there are many options available in the market. I have a 6 montha kid and I have used many options before buying Pampers Baby dry pants too. Most of them lacked at a point or another."
"But I am quite happy with Pampers Baby Dry Pants. From this diaper, my expectations are met with this."
"*Easy to change, just tear it from sides."
*Comfortable.
"* Does not affect skin (go for one bigger size if possible as it will not affect babies skin, as wet diapers damages babies skin)."
*Good ability to absorb.
Everything is good about it.

"Thanks a lot to Pampers for making this product so good. Softness, absorbency is just perfect & leak proof too. Totally worth item. It hasn't got any issues with leaking though my child is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odor. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Does not have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
I have been using pampers since long. My elder daughter who is 7 yrs now also used pampers and my younger one 1.5 yrs is using currently.  With its high absorbency and leak proof desigh and snug fit it is highly recommended for babies and kids . My babies never had the diaper rash problem since I have used Pampers
I have been using a lot of diapers of different brands to make sure i use the best one for my 1 year old. Pampers is the BEST!!! recently one of my friends sons outgrew his size of diapers n she gave me her xl size of huggies diapers but it is not even close to pampers. I follow the rule of changing the diapers every 4 hours during the day. At night I'm ashamed to say i drop off dead n the baby is left with wearing the same diapers for almost 8 hours....but its pure magic.....never had rashes....i give pampers full marks....no other brand is even close
Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 10 hours of dryness
Leak Proof
no rashes
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have.
I have invested in Pamper's Pant Style Diapers for my toddler since sometime now and I like that the inner layer sits right against his skin.
"The diapers are soft and keep my baby relatively dry. They very well take the moisture away from the surface, distribute the liquid and keep it within it’s absorbent core."
"Since a good fit is important for comfort and leak prevention, I like that diaper material is elastic and pleating around the leg edges."
"My friends i m subscribing it now, because m happy with it."
Let's I'll explain whats things about it i like.
I m sharing my experience after using it for my baby'
👶👶👶👶👶👶👶
* First of all its totally odorless tats  why I like the most.
* Its have very comfortable elasticity tats  why baby feel comfort.
"* No rashes issue ,its really appreciable."
* No leakage of any kind. Good for baby up to  5 kg of weight.
*  Gel advantage baby's skin soft and  rashes-free. So its worth of money.
* As my experiences its best for infants.
Highly recommended....

"As a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past, I find this more reliable. We have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
Review got deleted mistakenly but i still wants to post as it helps others to choose product
"There is literally nothing better than this product in the market. This product is the standard. And it does set high ones too. Having tried all kinds of brands of diapers I can confidently tell you Pampers is the best.. Huggies and libero were good when your little one is really tiny but Pampers takes care of toddlers the best.. the gusset fits perfectly and never leaks unless you have left on the diaper for a longer time or if you have taken a wrong size, (undersize or oversized).. yes I learnt this the hard way 😁"
So always take according to baby's weight.
"Clearly the best diapers available in the Indian market. I tried other brands also when my son was born but quickly realised that none of them matches the quality and softness of pampers. Have been using pampers ever since. I have never used any cloth diaper for my son although I bought quite a lot of them in anticipation of rashes due to disposable diapers. My son is 2.8 years now and except for a single episode of diaper rash, he never had any diaper rash or any other discomfort. I would advise all the new moms to go for these blindly. The quality will ensure that the soft skin of your baby is safe and the fact that they are disposable will save you from all the extra work and discomfort that comes with the use of cloth diapers."

I used both normal diapers & pants for my new born baby. Normal diapers are way too good & cottony soft. But these pants are a piece of plastic & the elastic on the pants gave elastic marks on my baby’s tummy. I don’t recommend using pants. Also pants are way lesser price than diapers. I bought pants & after observing this I just threw them away although it’s a wastage of money.
"We used Pampers with our first child with excellent results. We changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money. She started having yeast infection, rashes, and woke up fussing nightly. Medical treatment did not resolve symptoms. About 1 month into the switch we realized that her symptoms started after the diaper swap. Within 1 week of returning to Pampers we stopped topical treatment secondary to symptom resolution. She has been symptom free since. We should've have tried to cut the corner. Best of luck with your choice!"
this product pampers is really good i order this product for my daughter she is approx 2months old and i was worried about wheather she got rashes or itching. or she wear it or not but the quality of material is good and soft and it fit perfectly the size of dipper is not so bulky so that u can also put a underwear over it. she wear it approx 6 to 7 hours and pee lots of time but there is no leakage the magic gel is too good even she didnot get any rashes also. i hear lot of time wearing a dipper for kids is not good thing in summer but they are wrong. thanks for pampers
"I disappointed with Pampers as I not expected this type of cheap quality diaper pants. It leaks frequently, its not absorb efficiently so my child feel irritation and have rashes on skin, its not at all soft material is so cheap."
"Pampers are all time fav to moms Pampers pants diapers is the only product I trust and use for my baby. In terms of comfort, the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free. The 3 extra absorb channels,, The style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks."
I strongly recommend the Pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and money.I have heard
Overall using Pampers Diapers have been a great experience for me. I have been Pampering my baby with Pampers diapers :) :)
I purchased it for my nephews.the Quality was good nd absorb easily.
The quality of the product received was very poor. It started leaking after 4 hours. I have being using this diaper for my kid since a year but this time the product was very poor. I think its a fake product. I Had received  this type of fake product 3 months ago again this time same experience. This was not expected from pampers.
"Price is very Low, other market s high"
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..

Seriously unhappy with Amazon because we placed an order for pampers large . Due to the worst quality of the diaper . We tried to return the product. They told it can't be returned. So they assured me that they will provide me a return less refund. But it is still pending. Called 2 times and they assured it has processed from their end. And the refund reference number is 000601. I'm going to display the same message and share with my friends who constantly purchase from Amazon. Its not about money but every month I purchase. still a very bad follow up.
"Pampers products are really harsh on my baby’s skin. It leaves marks all around the diaper area which is very concerning. I neglected people’s opinion regarding the product but now thinking should have gone through it. Product is durable, super thin , everything is good but the only problem is it is horrible on baby’s skin. I will never ever compromise on my baby for this matter"
I've been using pampers for my baby for a long time. Known for keeping the wetness away this has been my go to brand.
With the new air channels being introduced the wetness us absorbed and allows flow of fresh air onto baby skin. The aloe lotion keeps the skin soft. The expandable waist band makes it easy for the baby to wear. Overall the baby bum stays dry the whole night. It's leakproof and cotton like softness is one of the reasons pampers is a trusted brand.
giving pamper to your baby is just like totally pampering to the child no rash no itching no spots no dark shading to skin etc. Its like total care of using pamper diaper even though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all. it good to use pamper said to all mom
pampers is very trusted brand and diapers are best in this range. me and my wife always worried about the baby hygiene and cleanliness and always think of product which will give protection to kids and are safe. this diapers are great in this matter and always give complete protection to babies and this diapers lock the wetness inside which makes the baby comfortable and diapers can be used comfotably. the size is exactly good for carrying in travelling. in travelling its very good to use.
Nothing is more important than the comfort of little baby. These diaper pants keep baby comfortable in the day as well as in night. cottony soft material is gentle on baby’s skin keeping their precious skin perfect. Good absorbing power observed used it for 8 hours or more. Really good product. Best diapers at best price. 
It is the 100% original product from Amazon. There is no any problem of rashes at all.
"Just go for it,I am sure you will not be unsatisfied with this product."
And thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..

I have purchased Pampers diapers online first time. I was worried about the
"product quality, but after getting the product in hand I am totally"
satisfied. I can tell you all that the product is genuine because last one year I have purchased diaper from various local shops and I know the original product quality. I am very happy with it and I am surely buy
Pampers diapers from amazon next in future. It gives comfort to my child and me as it is leak proof and easy to use.
"I have used Pampers earlier. It's a trustworthy brand. But don't know what happened this time. I bought the monthly box. Within half an hour of usage my baby had severe rashes, redness and itching in the diaper area. Terrible it is. Worst part they can't be returned also. My whole money got wasted. Each and every diaper of the box gave itching to my baby. So had to throw all in the dustbin."
"The fit of these diapers runs on the smaller side compared to other brands, which may mean you have to experiment before landing on the right side, or size up more quickly than you’d expect. “To avoid poop blowouts, purchase the next size up,” noted one mom. That said, for smaller babies, the close fit is perfect."
Baby is getting rashes and after urination the diaper is like very warm as in Luke warm water hotness and it stays that way for 15/20 mins even after removing it . I have used Pampers when bought from medical shop and never faced this . Somehow feels like of it's chemical reaction or something ..my baby is getting little bit of rashes .also the diaper itself feels more paperish than the Pampers I got from medical shop ..I have used Pampers from the time my baby is small but this is experience is weird .
These new pampers  diapers are no doubt better than other buggies in terms of durability. I know about the p&g product and their  quality. And baby feel comfortable while wearing it. And packaging  is hygiene.  And there is no issue of leaking and also too soft for baby  .pampers pent diapers  also fit to the baby
Lotion with Aloe Vera is Really nice & which help to protect child skin too.😍. It's cotton is very soft.. Magic Gel with light & dry too. Best Pampers for new born child go & buy now.
"Recently I picked these up and they are wonderful! I wouldn't have thought before I was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praise.They are soft, very absorbent and fits great.These diapers provide for long hours of leak-proof protection & are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortable.Totally love these diapers"
"Product quality is too good .. I'm using pampers for the very first day for my son ,he enjoys in pamper pant  .. he is wearing diaper a most of the day and dosen't get rash but from the other brands pampers are very genuine product .. super comfy , great absorbency ... over all i'm totally satisfied with pampers and should recommend to the other moms .. happy motherhood .. ..u can easily trust this brand for your newborns too..  I have no complaint till now"
Just tried considering all the branding and name but completely disappointed with the quality forget few hours not worth for few mins .. horrible Product will never buy worst no refund and return ...
"I bought from FirstCry and the quality is so much different. Better fragrance, liquid is not clogged at one spot but spreads more evenly. Better material and soft. All this while I purchased premium diaper due to this when she was less than a year. Later switched to standard did not have a good experience."
Ordered from FirstCry and then I felt the seller on Amazon cheated.
I have also tweeted about the same.
Worst diapers... Very cheap quality..bought 7 to 12kg but not even fitting for my 7kg baby... It leaves scars on his waist.... Very disappointed... Hope i cud return but cannot as i opened it... Not expected from pampers.. Worst experience ever... Went back to pampers active baby... Bit costly but active baby pampers are best for my baby as it will absorb pee more than 3times...just go for pampers active baby...
"I have been using Pampers baby dry pants for my baby girl. Earlier I used to feel guilty of making my baby wear diapers overnight since elders said it's not good for their skin. But when I tried Pampers I was really happy with the product, since it kept her dry at night for a longer time. She feels comfortable while playing, sitting, crawling, since it's flexible and soft. There are no diaper band marks on her thighs. Have not experienced any kind of severe rashes till now. It's very easy to pull them on the baby with the kind of active movements while making her wear. Have tried Huggies and Mamypoko also, but I find Pampers baby dry the most comfortable."
"Although am not a pampers favouring.  I've used them extensively for my 6 months old, especially when we had a major trip out of India. These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours. But now I've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now, leaving marks on her thighs. Anyway, it was a good time pampering my girl, until she gets to the larger group"
This product is just not right for babys gentle skin.
I got the small size as my baby 5+  kgs in weight . These pant style diapers are too tight on the waist and leave a mark on the thighs as well .
I could feel my baby was uncomfortable hence did not use it .
Best is to go for the taped diapers which can be adjusted as per baby size.
Highly dissapointed.
Absolutely
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..

Pampers is my choice when I buy diapers for my baby.!
The reason I choose these diapers only is they are good absorbent and yet they are extremely soft. No rashes issues. The most important thing about this is till date never had any leakage issue.!
Amazing.
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 18 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable..I always buy"
Pampers diapers from Amazon because it give great and best discount possible.. without any second thought go for it.
Its a good product with supersoft and super absorbant material.
"Its cottony soft material prevents developing rashes. Its magic gel helps locks wetness for up to 10-12 hours. It fits comfortably, closer to the baby’s body ."
Goodness of aloevera lotion prevents babys skin from any type of irritation and its air channels provides proper movement of air inside daiper to maintain freshness and dryness.
I recomment for daily use for those having babies.
Worst item I received boz it’s leaking with every time baby poop. I used mamy poko pants previously for 4 month never faced leakage issue with it changed boz baby got little bit rashes. But I think wrong decision in choosing pampers diaper. Very much disappointed. Its showing can’t replace or return so wat now. What the use of wearing diaper if poop is leaking out every time. Worst diaper I bought from amazon.
"First off, every child is different and every child has different reactions to diapers. All 3 of my children have been in Pampers. No diaper rash medicine ever needed. My oldest two I put in Luvs when they got older. Around 2. My youngest is just now turning 2 and he will be sticking with Pampers. With every brand of diaper I have tried with him he had leaked through except pampers. And its is very soft than others brands. All my children have gotten rashes from Huggies. But I don't blame them, there is just something in them that don't agree with my children. I know a lot of people think that when buying Pampers you're paying more for the name, but in my case it has been the best. So as a caution. If your child gets a bad diaper rash and your not sure why, change your brand."
"This isn't leakproof. The absorbency has come down. Until the time we used the large size daiper there were no issues. Since we started to use the xl size things were a mess. The daiper doesn't even stay dry for 4 hrs ( claims of 12 hrs dryness seems like a joke now). My baby's weight is 12.5kg, hence changed to xl. Absolutely dissatisfied. I had to cancel the subscription."
Never before this order did I face leakage issues with Pamper diapers. The potty stained the pants almost everyday and surprisingly inspite of diaper being worn there was bed wetting which also disturbed the baby's sleep and made him very irritable.
PS : There was no size mismatch in selection. Bought a pack of Pampers from local market and there were no leakage issues.
"Pampers baby-dry pants style diapers are the only pants in India to whom I can trust overnight, just because of breathable dryness,  we are using these diapers from day one. Pampers that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness"
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body  so I can't  think to change other dipaer.  And we all use  aloevera in our daily routine so why don't use with baby's diapers.Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation"
"Cotton like soft material, my baby can sleep very comfortable."
"I was using xyz diapers for a very long time.They were soft but used to be leaky and heavy within 6 hours.But ever since I was introduced to Pampers baby dry pants(lotion with aloe vera),my baby is more active because diaper is no more heavy or leaky even if the diaper is on for 10 hours.Also she gets a good night sleep because it’s comfortable and soft.My husband has stocked up on a large packet of the same.Unlike other diapers this doesn’t get teared.Packaging is good too."
As usual does the purpose
Have been purchasing diapers from this brand for soo long.
Still now no issue have been there
My little brother is soo relaxed.and my mom also.
Absorbancy is good and can hold for long.
Pampers helps every mom in everyday life..
And i am also helpful to mom.cause i get at low price than from offline stores
Thnks amazon
It is soft and doesn't give any type of rashes. Fits very well with more comfortness and Keep ur baby dry at whole night with its long lasting magic gel feature that really works and locks wetness away. This is the best among in class daipers.
"My first ever diapers purchased from online and thank u amazon and seller for ur fast delivery, received within 15 hrs just after one night gap."
"I use pampers pants for my kids from the time they were born . These pant are so comfortable for kids and are skin friendly. You can get these pants at affordable price from amazon if u r on tight budget . Pampers pant are so light weighted , soft and never had leaks complain ever. Earlier I use other brand diapers but they were not up to the mark but when it comes to pampers pants it never loose elastic . It has a magic gel and has great absorption channel and has breathable soft belt and cuff . Overall thanks pampers for this and i must say to buy these diapers for your kids....."
"I doubt genuineness of the product. Quality is so poor that its difficult to believe its made by pamperes. If its genuine then pamper is selling an extremely poor products. The product doesn't do the basic job it is supposed to do. It doesn't absorb. Size is also smaller. Before this i used for my baby Huggies, Mamy Poco and was totally satisfied. Amazon customer please do not get misled by rating or favourable review. Stay away from this item."
A good product for your baby.Material is soft so no worry of rashes or discomfort.
Magic gel does what it has too and improved design helps in more comfortness to baby's skin.Waist band is one more good feature of it.You can use lotion with aloe vera if your baby's skin is extra sensitive to overcome rashes however I don't think there'll problem of it if you use this product
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
Till now never had the problem of urine leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very happy and impressed with pampers diaper pants and recommend this to all looking out for diapers
The absorbency is very good. It absorbs quickly and doesn't get wet for long time. It is also leak proof as the pampers fits great and there's no space for leakage. The material used to make pampers is very soft and it can be used for long time. I think this is the best selling diaper among others.I purchased it from Amazon and the delivery was also quick.
"We are using pamper for babies since they are 6 month old. Now they are 21 months old and we shift to large size from medium. This was my second or third order, 9 or 10 Pampers out of 164 nos was good one but rest was completely damage. It's look like pamper are damage from side like some one teared it from side. This should reject during quality check of finished product. We regularly using pampers for babies. Company should work on quality of product it's leaking badly, we faced this problem in past during use of medium size. Kindly make some quality check at Amazon end also. We are purchasing this considering Amazon certified product hence please check the quality."
"Based on Trust, purchased Pampers. But the quality and absorb proof is not up to the mark. It can be used 3-4 hours max for 18 months baby. Urine is not spreading entire diaper and it's stay in one place like a ball."
There is no return option and it's waste of money. Never ever buy Pampers product like this.
"No other words to say, Simply Waste."
Perfect companion for my toddler.Absorbs all the fluid but with delicacy.The soft waist band fits very well yet doesn't give any rashes on the baby's skin.So my baby always feels very happy and relaxed.It has also magic gel with aloe vera to lubricate my baby's skin against diaper irritation.I am pretty sure my baby is loving it as i can guess from his smile.Thanks for this product pampers as u really pamper the babies as well as the parent's feelings.
Pampers a well known product by P&G. Recently ordered this product for my new born Nephew.
New air channels technology with thin and soft layer of cotton like material on top.
Which keeps the baby dry for the whole night with magic gel that locks wetness away and its aloe lotion helps to protect the baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation. 
Without thinking twice just place the order.
This is one of the best products. It has baby lotion with aloe Vera that helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation. It has also air channels that providing your baby a new type of dryness overnight. I am happy to purchase it for my baby .he also like to wear for it compatible design. Value for money. Recommended to every one for  try this product.
"Pampers New Diapers Pants, Medium size is one of the best Pampers bought as well as the trusted product.  The absorbency is the crucial thing and that is up to there mark. This Pampers is full value for money. The Pampers are leak-proof as well, help the baby to sleep comfortably. This Pampers prevent etching as well, because of there softness. Highly recommended Pampers."
"I have been using the premium pants for a while, and will vouch for its efficacy. Now i just thought of trying the dry pants. It is to be worn as pants and is more suited for babies above 6 months. I generally do not recommend diapers all the time, however, these are convenient for outdoors. They do deliver the promise of keeping our babies light and dry."
" It is absorbant, lasts all night and fits well to not cause any discomfort to my baby. As its name says it pampers my baby's skin. Also being a mom can be tiresome and overwhelming. A diaper that fits well and lasts long is a BIG help!"
"I have received pamper on this month, very bad product, not for use."
I doesn't stand even 2-3 hr.  It also leak.
"Earlier the same product is good, my baby is using this product by Amazon from last 2 year, but this time quality is very poor."
I want to replace the product.
Please do not buy these pampers diaper it is total waste of money worst diaper.  I have been using Huggies always for my kid but my friend told me to try pampers so this time I ordered pampers damn they made up such a bad quality that it can't even stay for 3hrs damn they lie please don't buy pampers I would suggest to go for Huggies the best diapers.
Bought this for my niece and she feels very comfortable wearing it. It also lasts longer as there is no leakage. Material is very soft in short i am in totally love with the product. I ordered this just for a month but now i will buy more.
"We all heard about pampers and it's a well known baby diaper company. Trusting the brand, I go with the product. But since the diaper waist is low, when my child passed out her poop, it leaked out from the waist. We can't always predict when a child will pass his/her poop, right? For safeguarding her urine, it works fine though. Therefore, I had to switch to another diaper brand and I'm happy to chose Teddyy premium diaper. Lesser price and works better for my child."
It was a blunder to get Pampers. This size is smaller or equivalent to the S size. I got the mega size which now I am changing every after 2 hours so that my baby is not soffocated and secondly to get over with the pack.
We have been using Pampers product from last many years but this time I'm very much disappt with quality as durability is not good and Early leakage. Material quality is also not good.  I have opted for L size but looks like L size diaper...Kindly send the normal comfort diapers which stays for 6-8hrs.. check the quality before delivery. I think action has to be taken quickly on this as many have the same concern
Not happy with the product
Don't think it's the original product
"M using the pampers from last ten months n was very satisfied with the product but was getting from the market .i have first time ordered from online n it seems to be  a fake product ,so request the company amazon also to plz look into the quality of the product n I really don't want even a single star to give ,highly disappointed with the product 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
"Pack contains two types of mixed diapers.  Both are differed in cartoon print and quality.  One of them is really good,  seems original.  But another cartoon print diaper is very dirty.  It over fill within 2_3 hours. Cotton starts  coming out within half an hour.  It just don't have durability to hold wetness.  However another one is seems original and lsts for 7_9 hrs.  I tried for both the cotton print diapers, meaningfully observed this for 2_3 consecutive days and then only writing this review. There is some issue with the pack.  This happening second time with me.  Same experience with mamy loko pants as well.  I got completely duplictae diapers pack. There is some duplicate diapers mixed in the pack. Please take a note."
I have been using pampers since ever and it is the best for my baby. Though in between intried some other brand diaper but i was not satisfied enough and switched back to pampers.
It is extra soft on my baby's skin and he does not get any irritation and rashes..
It also stays dry for a longer period of time without any leaks.
The best part about this diaper is it has aloe vera baby lotion which keeps my baby's skin healthy .
I am very much satisfied with pampers and obviously I am not switching to any other brand for my baby ever.
This pampers pants is great....its is a great brand... these pants are very comfortable to the body.....as well as it do not leaks ....it xn soke upto many times....i highly recommend it to use it for u kids
"I have been buying this for my baby for past 18 months. Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was satisfactory quality.... but this new pack with""AIR CHANNEL"" is extremely inferior and poor quality and it leaks after 2-3hrs.... very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately"
"Using this for my nephew boy age 3 months. Its soft material and powerful absorbency helps the baby to stay dry. I will continue to use only pampers, no other brand gives such great comfort and leak proof performance. Happy with the product."
"This is the best diaper I have used so far. One diaper is enough for full night/day. Holds a lot of liquid, about 6 glasses which is more than required for any baby. The fitting is just perfect for my baby n it doesn't slip or open up."
Quality alway g8
I was using huggies premium taped diapers for my new born and then moved to this with size S
"It leaves mark on the stomach, poty check is difficult in pant style, this is personal choice however I would like to go with taped diaper on my nxt purchase."
"I felt this required to be changed every 2 hour, not happy."
"This doesnot have a wet indicator line, neither disposable roll"
I opened the pack and all the 5 Diapers used till now leaked!!!!!! Even the usual Pampers are very soft this
particular product is lil harsh....Looks the product is duplicate!!!!!
I have used previously from 3 months Pampers Don't know why This issue ?
Request Amazon to look whether its Supply problem or seller problem
"I usually order this from Amazon and have received a good bunch in the past. Somehow this batch of diapers seem to be of really bad quality and are causing too many rashes.By end of the day, my daughter is howling in pain and I have to regularly apply an ointment. Not sure if I can return this for a refund"
best product for my baby. and i always buy something which i can trust 100% for my baby. The soft and smooth Pampers baby pants adjusts to my baby's skin very well and its very light weight to wear. The price of pants is too much reasonable and the quality is very high. I have tried so many brands till now but Pampers has satisfied me to the fullest.
I'm buying pampers pant style diaper for my baby since more than a year. The product quality that I received 3days ago is not as ever before and it is written 'aloe' infront of each diaper. Even earlier diaper packets were of aloe lotion type but it is not written in the diaper.
"Text in front is not a problem, diaper thickness is reduced and it was not able to withstand whole night. I had to change the diapers in the midnight to avoid leakage."
Writing this review after a trail for 3days with this modified diaper.
I am a regular buyer of pampers daiper you can also view my order details where I have purchased more no of daiper..but this time I have to bring it to your notice that aftr using this particular one my child is being suffering through serious rashes... before bringing it to your notice and also Putting such remarks I compared with the other daiper of the same brand I can see the difference...both the product looks the same but when you smell it there is a difference from the one which I brought from Amazon.. usually I buy all my products from Amazon pantry. But after having such problem with my child I had to immediately buy it from a near by chemist. And from there  I compared n I CLD make the difference..now how are you guys going to help me when all of the daipers will be a waste because I cannot use it. And it's not a small amount. It's the 1st time I am facing such problem but the 1st has been an nightmare for my child... please suggest what shld I do with the rest of the daipers I have hardly used  more than 4
"Have been using pampers for the last four years. First for my son. Now for my daughter. It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power, and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have. It is also economical if you check the price per diaper.Thanks to amazon."
Cushiony Cotton Soft Material all round keeps my baby’s precious skin perfect. Outstanding Absorption Upto 12 Hours wraps my baby in a world of comfort. Advanced Dry Touch Sheet keeps my baby dry all night long. Super-Stretchy Material fits my baby like a mother’s Hug. Double Leakguard to keep my baby full sleepy in night. I highly recommend this diaper. A must buy diaper.
"My first choice is ""Amazon"". Better to buy through subscribe and save.It is the best one for babies than any other brand diapers. Bought it for my little sister during winter they can sleep whole night comfortably, there is no leakage problem and the best thing is in morning also it is dry. It is number one in softness and absorbency. Everything is OK but it is a bit expensive than Huggies and many poko pants."
"I have a 3 year boy who still not potty trained, my boy uses this diapers which are very confortable for him, he runs a lot, climbs all the stuff, jumps... I have a very active child, diapper does not have leakages. Its also thin so its discreet but absorves a lot. I dont understand the negative reviews, maybe just a bad experience from diferent seller. I get mine always from cloudtail India and always is nicely packed and fast delivery as well. I buy XL for my son and suits perfectly but he is also slim but tall so buy according to your childs weight. Its worth it, a good value for money a superb quality and easy to use. Buying it again soon :)"
Since from my baby birth I am using pampers dipers.
I love pampers dipers very much
Because it's
Has 24hr absorbency
It is leak proof and
Its has too soft ness that my were it comfortable
Till now there is no rassesh on my baby skin
It really keep baby skin soft and smooth.
This is choice of all mothers for its baby
Material is really soft and being in pant style easy to make kids wear. The quality of this product is good. Kids feel comfortable while wearing it & also it lasts for good 5-6 hours. The packaging is hygiene. Would recommend it to all.
I would like to thank the pamper diaper pants because of which I'm able to sleep at night in peace.No more sleepless night now!!!! The material is so soft that it's totally rashfree. The gel inside creates like a magic and always keeps the skin dry... It's cent percent leak proof too. The aloe vera helps to keep the skin soft and totally rash free. No more need to apply and rashfree cream or lotion now.
Ive been using Pampers pant style dipers from the last 5 years for my daughter and now for my son too...i have never face any issue with its quality. Infact the diapers have never leaked or torn out. They last the entire night without any issue. Pant style are easy to put it on for the kids. I have been using it for a long time and can vouch for it.

"Original review: March 4, 2019"
"We used Pampers with our first child with excellent results. We changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money. She started having yeast infection, rashes, and woke up fussing nightly. Medical treatment did not resolve symptoms. About 1 month into the switch we realized that her symptoms started after the diaper swap. Within 1 week of returning to Pampers we stopped topical treatment secondary to symptom resolution. She has been symptom free since. We should've have tried to cut the corner. Best of luck with your choice!"
Pampers dry pants are good quality diapers.  It is superior and longer at the back in comparison to other brands and they do a fair job. This is my choice For night time sleeps.
"I had tried about every brand of nappies to try and keep my baby dry all night without having to change her. These were the only ones that actually delivered on their promise. Price is competitive, no regrets !! Nice product overall.."
"I have tried many diapers for my son but every time some issue arouse like rashes, leak proof or softness so my friend suggested this. It's been 5 days my son using their is no leak proof and their is no rashes also. And also material is soft. The only issue is the elastic material is bit fit otherwise its must use for children."
These are the only diapers I will use. They are gentle on my babies skin and it takes A LOT to make them leak (as long as they are properly put on; hard to do on a squirmy little one I know). I am allergic to latex and these diapers are the only one i have tried that doesn't break me out and contains the contents well. Very close to feeling like cloth diapers. Pampers did a good job.
"We have been using Pampers XL size for a long time now. But this product(sold under brand name Pampers) is of cheap quality. It does not soak much. Till morning, diapers start overflowing."
I purchased 2 pampers from a nearby shop to compare the quality. I must say that the latter one soaks much better than this one.
I am completely dissatisified with this retailer's product and decided to not purchase from this retailer again in future.
Pampers have always been the first choice when it comes to diapers. And yes when you have to buy for your baby nothing is a compromise. This has been a choice from day 1 and we rely on Pampers till date. The absorbency is great. The material is soft and doesn’t cause any itching or rages in baby’s skin. Recommended to all new parents!
I ordered this for my Nephew and the quality of the product is good...
It is a nice product and a little relax now from the frequent baby crying.
Have been using for the last four years. First for my son. Now for my daughter. It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have. It is also economical if you check the price per diaper
"It becomes full fast n heavy wen ur toddler urinates..unlike wen u buy d same brand frm international destination wich v bought wen v were Outta country. V tried Himalaya pants as well but tht used to get filled up faster then these pamper pants. So if u use Himalaya pants, then this is d better option."
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
Till now never had the problem of urine/stool leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and pro active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very impressed with pampers diaper pants
Poor quality.  Hardly lasts 6 hrs.  Have to wake up at night to change it otherwise it overflows n soils bedsheet. Also it doesn't keep baby dry even during use.  maybe its amazon selling substandard diapers to show big discounts
"Would love to thanks Pamper team for creating this amazing pants with goodness of aloe vera, my baby's skin is sensitive diaper does not suits him but this range is luxourious, does not give any harm or rashes to the skin , the quality is amazing and its more absorving, help my baby to sleep peacefuly during nights!!!!"
"Pampers, my trust for my baby. I like this diaper as it absorb more.. Leak proof and vey soft from inside so that my baby feel good all the time. Came with good packaging and on time."
Pant style diapers are very easy to use and after using easy to dispose. Thank you Amazon for providing good service.
"Easy to use It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"This product is really nice and I use it for my 9 months baby and it works very well I make him this diapers the whole night and the absorption power is really good my baby sleeps nicely and its too comfortable. So, I don't have any issues with the diaper he feels nice and when he feels nice I am happy with the product."
"Out of 86 I had used only one diaper, the experience was terrible. For the first 20 mins I was surprised why my 6 month old baby is crying subsequent realised the entire bum has swollen in to red... No way I can think of Pampers ever"
"We loved these Pampers Swaddlers diapers. now we have a new baby, these are the only diapers I'll buy. They are excellent quality, far superior to Huggies and Luvs. The Swaddlers are so soft and flare easily around the legs and the tabs stay put on the front of the diaper, so with both girls, we've never had a blowout or leaky diaper. These easily hold 8 hours worth of urine from the baby sleeping all night and don't even leak when she sleeps on her belly with her behind up."
"I read a lot of reviews that the material is substandard and the child had leakage after wearing these hence giving a notion that it's better to buy from shop than online from Amazon,so I was very dicy in ordering it,nonetheless I did and to my utter surprise they were as good and effective to use as the one I would buy from shop..Since then I have always been buying from them..May be it depends upon the seller for the product..Anyways my experience of the same was perfect..No issues so far.."
I am extremely excited to collaborate with Pampers - a brand that I have believed in very strongly from Day 1! I literally carried a packet of Pampers to the labour room having made it crystal clear to my doc that my baby should be made to wear Pampers only!
"Interestingly, Pampers is what Pampers does.. pampers your baby's skin with air channels for an awesome experience of dryness! It lets your baby be comfortable and move around without any feeling of itchiness and irritation! Some of the interesting features that I totally swear by:"
1. Lotion with Aloe Vera - Helps protect my baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation.
2. Super soft
3. Playful designs on the exterior
4. Flexible waistband for comfort movement
From one mommy to another.. do yourselves a favour..pamper your baby with Pamper.
"I have been purchasing pampers pants diapers since many months and I was satisfied with the quality.. But this time I am very much disappointed and angry with the seller.. I have ordered monthly box of diapers and I have received fake product this time. There is no xl written on diaper, material is hard and rough, my baby is so uncomfortable in these. Absorbency is also not up to the mark.. Now I m afraid to order this in future again"
"I have been ordering diapers on Amazon and always received good products. However this time I ordered the monthly mega box and have received duplicate diapers. It does not even last for 2 hrs. The elastic around the thighs break easily and causes leakage. This is forcing me to change double number of diapers a day. No return or refund. Very disappointed.. I buy products regularly from Amazon, but now am skeptical to order anything"
I like this product caz it's very soft and comfortable to kids. Material quality superb and your durability up to 12 hour
I practically swear by this product.  I have tried many other brands and types but Pampers pants style diapers are the best. They keep my baby's skin dry and stay dry longer . Along with this they now also have aloe which is very good for baby skin.  It's super convenient to use as I can very easily tear side and change it.  I totally recommend it for all babies
It's a fake product..its absorbency is 0..and it leaks ..using same product which I bought from retail shop and very satisfied with that but with online product this is happening for the second time that the quality is so poor that I cant evn use it..moreover I cant return this product as well ...useless for me ..cant trust online for dis nymore afterall it's for babies who really have delicate skin ..
"I got Pampers pants on subsciption basis, and as a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past, I find this more reliable. We have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
"Product was defective. It can not maintain dryness for even 3 hours. During night it is leaking and I had to get up 2 to 3 times to change diapers. Since I disposed off the packaging, I could not return it. This is my first bad experience from amazon"
Worst product ever received by Amazon. My baby got terrible rashes with boils due to this diaper. I would never recommend it for any baby. Kindly do not experiment with your babies tender body using this useless product. Amazon being such a leading brand should verify the products of the seller. I can never believe that pampers being such a big brand could sell such cheap quality diapers.
My Brother Baby spends whole night peacefully after wearing Pampers pants &
It's the most trusted brands since ages so without a fail it's carrying on it's legacy and it passed on from my mother to me and I'm happy with it's use.
Love Pampers because my Brother baby loves it too & is comfortable for her
"Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was of very good quality....but this new pack with""  AIR CHANNEL  "" is of wrost quality and leaking after 2 - 3hrs....very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately."
I bought pampers-premium one and that meets standard of good diapers...
"This one is like other cheap diapers and don't come with lock blue tape, because of which its unhygienic after getting soiled and needs one poly bag to cover, which is again not environment friendly..."
Useless product... It get leak even after 3 to 4 pee. Also baby's bambee remains wet . I had never expected that from pampers.. While I have use pamper active baby for my newborn baby that was so good but this S size pamper pants are very poor in quality and durability... So many diapers are left as I have ordered 86 piece pack... Only used 17 of them
"I am using this product for my child since last 2 years. It was really good in previous times but this time I ordered and subscribed it for repeat orders, I got really worst product ie rejected material they are selling in lower price. It starts leaking in just 2-3 pees in 1.5-2 hrs. Not expecting this from pampers. Also not expected from this seller."
Great Product. So Soft. Parents can live tension free life if they use pampers for their children.
Waist band gives full flexibility to baby's movements and magic gel locks wetness well.
And Parents should consider using any baby lotion along with pampers to protect baby skin from diaper rash.
It's too soft like cotton but doesn't contain cotton. It has magic gel which is absorbe all liquid and baby feel comfortable. It's big solution of diaper rashes problem. In rainy season my baby wear diaper for whole day and night I change it time to time but he is free from rashes problem. Seriously this is  best for babies.
We generally use Pampers for our kid. But this box was not good. Every single piece leaked and leaked in the same manner - at waistline. Not happy with this box. Either this is a fake product or the quality from Pampers have degraded. Two boxes in a row that had similar problems. Have now cancelled subscription.
Nice quality Diapers for kids...
I am happy with the results of using Pampers pant style diapers.
There is no complaint of urine leaks.
"Size is perfect. Comfortable and flexible waist band, no irritation or red marks after using pampers diapers."
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
I recommend pampers diaper pants to my knowns...
I loved how soft and comfortable these diapers are. They keep my baby dry throughout the day. I use it at bedtime or when I had to go outside for the long time. It is true to it's claim and keeps baby dry for the longest time. My baby has not suffered rashes using it. I am very happy with these diapers!!! Would recommend it to all mom's!
"It was a bad experience since last two orders. Pampers has lost its glory. Its either duplicate or second quality. Doesnt even work for two hours, it starts leaking and baby has to suffer the wet ness. Poor quality  and waste of time and money."
Giving pamper to my baby is just like really its totally pampering to child no rash no itching no spots no dark shadding to skin etc.its like total care of using pamper diaper ever  though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all. It good to use pamper said to all mom....
My baby spends whole night peacefully after wearing Pampers pants &
It's the most trusted brands since ages so without a fail it's carrying on it's legacy and it passed on from my mother to me and I'm happy with it's use.
Love Pampers because my baby loves it too & is comfortable for her
"The current product delivered was of worse quality...my baby had started developing rashes within one hour of usage, diaper doesn't have any soaking capability..the item is of such a poor quality atleast 10% of the diapers could not be used since they were getting damaged on normal handling...I have ordered pampers product earlier but have not experienced such worse quality item"
"This is first time I am using pampers.earlier I was buying mamypoko pants, for which I have never faced any issue.This time the wastes are coMing out of pamper pants which is pathetic and completely unhygienic for baby.I would not go for pampers ever."
"Have been ordering Pampers from Amazon through cloudtail india seller, which was genuine;this order was provided by other seller..sigma.. which is definitely not genuine."
My baby has got rashes after using only a single diaper of this packet.
Ratings for this seller was 4.6 .. Request Amazon to verify before giving such ratings to sellers.
"Oh my pampers are life savers. I have been using this product on my baby since she was born and believe me its a boon for mothers as well as for babies. The softness, flexibility of it makes it my favourite brand. While using it I never found it leaking, or any rash on baby's skin and its absorption is commendable. Awesome product.. Love its fragrance.. Value for money. Happy baby happy mamma!"
"I am using pamper since the birth of my son..and he is 2 now...and still a daiper baby, though he pee and poops a lot...but not even a single time the pamper daiper have leaked nor spilled..plus it so soft.. doesn't even leave daiper marks or I have faced rash problem using them."
I gifted a set of diapers to my Sister for her new born baby girl. She said it is very easy to use and also very comfortable for their baby girl. She sleep well in night and their is no leakage problem at all. Overall they thanks me for such a useful gift. I think this is a safe product for new born baby skin.
"See, this time Pampers has lower down its quality a lot. Not a promising quality at all. Diaper leaks within 6-7 only even I have taken Large size diapers according to my kid's weight. I would not suggest anyone to buy this. Do not trust this brand at all. I would like to return or exchange it as it's an expensive thing."
"Since last 1 and half years, I have been buying this product and I had no complaint about the product, but this time, I the quality of the product is unimaginable. first I thought it to be improved design, but in the first use it shows its quality. But to my dismal, the new, so called improved product is awful. It leaked every nights and I. The product quality is inferior and never expected Pampers to introduce such a disappointment."
"Have been using these products from my nephew born, Excellent fit and baby smiles whenever worn. It smells really really nice, comfortable and easy to wear it even my nephew didn't have any diaper rash problem . Lasts longer and so smooth to change the pamper, does heavy duty and holds longer"
"This is not at all a good product as once the child pie in it,it starts leaking out its a very cheap quality product and very thin.i think its a duplicate product cant expect this type of product from pampers or AMAZON."
As i m a regular customer of AMAZON i expect that Amazon will replace this product.
"The quality of material use is good as rarely happened that the diaper leaked. It is very good easy put it as it a pant style diaper. The fitting is not tight over skin if you choose the right size. The only thing that has to be kept in mind is, you need to pick a larger size if you were previously using pampers. If you were using large then you will have to buy x-large."
"pampers baby dry pants are cotton like soft and contains lotion with aloe vera which protects baby skin, my baby has super sensitive skin and gets rashes easily but she didnot get any after using these diapers.. also it soaks and keeps dry for along time which is very helpful as there is no leakage which helps babies sleep peacefully entire night!"
"Quality is Bad,,,  I have used Pampers M & L which is good quality, But XL quality is very Bad in material. Always it is in leakage condition at Night. My baby is 14kg but overflow it. Don't buy XL Size Pampers."
Pathetic diapers. Very very pathetic diapers. Leaking in every second pee. I am sure these are duplicate diapers. And unfortunately no return policy. Pampersndojt play with ur name for a small amt if money
I have been using Pampers ordered from Amazon since last 2 years for my child...
But this particular consignment is fake.it does not soke at all...Generally a pamper product is good enough for the entire night
..But this product does not even last for 2 hours..My son's clothes are getting drenched...The dealer/supplier of this particular consignment should be banned from amazon..It is spoiling the name of Amazon..Probably I will not be ordering Pampers in online mode ever
The quality of Pampers has reduced and the New Air channel package is blunder from Pampers.
"If you can find the previous package Extra Absorb channels, please buy that package only."
Looks like Pampers lacks proper quality checks and is a total disappointment.
"If you are using it for babies, be ready to handle the leakages very frequently."
It is a Defective product due to wrong Design.
"Something very fishy about this pack of diapers, I have been ordering pampers for the last 3 years for two kids and This pampers size medium comes With a design that similar to size small and to the surprise even the diapers are of a smaller size than usual Medium size. The gel doidnt work properly,diapers getting torn ,and leaks in few minutes . worst experience. Don't / never recommend to buy this product"
"Do not buy this product. I am a regular customer of this product on Amazon . No doubt, Price is low than other sites but there is a reason behind. Size is reduced now. Also i have a doubt on authenticity. It is not medium sized diapers that they used to be. Disappointed."
"The diaper pants are not suitable for New borns. Wetness isn’t distributed within the whole diaper as a result back side gets filled up soon(new babies sleep on back all day), and then the diaper leaks."
The diapers gave very bad rashes to my little baby.
Pampers diapers are soft. In pack we get 20 count. Baby can wear 1 diaper whole night also its leak proof. No bad smell after removing it in morning. My baby is 1 month old these diaper size is good for him.
I have ordered  Pampers large176 pieces 15 days back. I have never scene this much worst quality from Pampers. I have been ordering since 5 years for both my babies. This is the first time that i have seen that all the pieces are very thin and easily teared. No leak proof as well. Please look in to the matter and arrange me the option to return or refund this ASAP.
Best one I have bought for my baby. 2 years now not even a single complaint so far. No allergy or rashes and one last up to 12 hours.This product alone specifically delivers in 2 days by amazon everytime and I don't know why. If they could  provide other products also at this speed it would be great.
I am writing this review on behalf of my sister as i ordered it for her baby. This is one of the best diapers available in the market and other companies does only false claims. The baby stays happy and cheerful all the time. No leaks whatsoever. Will order again as soon as this gets over.
"We are using this product for our baby from last 3-5 months, It's a great product.. Material is so soft and  no rashes."
Magic gel absorbs wetness away for up to 8 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product is a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with ALOE VERA helps protect baby’s delicate skin from rash and irritation
My choice 👩 Pampers...
. .
"Pampers is a very well known brand in 👶 diapers. From since our child born, doctors and all of our known suggest that 💛yellow pack new baby Pampers for your new born. But why?"
. .
There should be something na because of that everybody recommend it always...
. .
"For me, it is just like 👩. The first touch after doctors your baby get is Pampers. Yes it Pampers the baby just like a mom..."
. .
It is very soft and thin.have breathable belt and cuffs that keeps your baby fresh and aloe vera lotion to protect 👶 skin...
. .
You can purchase it from Amazon...
.
.
P. S. Helps the baby to get a goodnight sleep...
I bought these diapers with the hope of getting a genuine product which will be comfortable for my baby however when I received the product I was shocked to see the quality of the diaper it's so pathetic I cannot believe it's from Pampers as I have already used their diapers however note to all parents if u r looking for price n not comfortability of the baby then please go ahead n buy these pathetic diapers.
"First of all thanks to amazon for 2 days delivery in prime services. Super packing by the seller . Superb quality, leak proof,. Easy to use and change. Extremely comfortable for baby also as well as parent is tension free. Must buy for small baby. While going to travel very usefull."
I am using this from the first day my daughter was born and I started using the diapers..
They are super soft and super absorbent..
They are completely leak proof and I am in love with the fragrance  and they are the best diapersin the market
"Excellent diapers from pampers. It lasts for long time, and also without any leakage. This product is also very soft, and for that there is no rash on the skin. The absorbency is pretty good. I think this is the best diaper in the market."
I ordered this product and has been using for for my kid for the last 3 weeks I went out of station for couple of days and due to an emergency I had to buy a smaller package from a local shop the difference in quality between the product that I bought from Amazon and the product I bought from the local shop is very huge the one I bought from the locker shop was the same size but had a smaller quantity compared to the Amazon product but it had better absorbency and had better quality so when it's time to buy the next package I would definitely rethink whether I should go for the product in Amazon or whether I should buy a better quality product from a local shop
It's a great product .material is soft so no rashes and no tension too. Magic gel that locks wetness. I find this more reliable . Super thin my baby Could wear any dress over it. This diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep.
I have been purchasing diapers of the same company and of same size and same quantity of packets as well from big bazaar and other super markets. But quality of this product is not same.
  Don't know why and how same multinational  company is providing different quality on different platforms
"Excellent product, it absorbs well whole night baby was wet free. Doesn't leak.buy proper size of your baby. This brand has appropriate size pampers to age and weight. It's soft doesn't leave mark on baby's skin. I loved it. Even fragrance is good doesn't smell medicine."
I have been using mamy poko pants diaper for my kid. For who changed I tried using these diapers because they were slim. Opposite to my expectations they were very unreliable. They would leak and has a very less absorption power. I had to order another packet of mamy poko pant and there is working fine. Pathetic quality buy pampers I will never use them.
As always Pampers is a very trustworthy brand so this time also it won't disappoint you. They are very comfortable for the babies and they are of good size too. They are made with such material with which air can be passed so that baby will love it.
"This is a duplicate product, I was embarrassed in public because of this product. It has 0% absorbency and 100% leaky...  I bought it for my 8 month old daughter and she kept tossing in her sleep at night because after just 6 hrs of using this thing becomes full and leaks on the bed.  Totally against what they are advertising. Don't go for this 100% leakage."
"I bought pampers diapers for my 8 month old daughter but these are the worst kind my daughter gets rash around her buttocks and vagina, previously I was using cuddles and supplies brand never had such issues, will never buy these again, u guys can check online there r lot of issues with pamper diapers in other countries too most common is rash, will never recommend to anyone , don't take even if they r providing free of cost."
Best quality diapers..material is very good absorbing capacity is very good..no leakage problem..softer than other diapers..protects the baby from any kind of rashes..it fits well and I have never faced any issues with this diapers...the baby remains dry and comfortable for a long time...highly recommended.
Pamper Active keeps baby active
1. Material is very good.
2. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
3. Absorbing capacity is very good.
4. Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal pamper diapers.
"Do not compete with Pamper premium, but this is very good."
Please do not go for normal pamper diapers because there are lots of complains about its quality.
"Hope this review will help to all of you. Once you use it, you will not find any word of this review wrong."
"Think this was a duplicate item. I was using normal diapers earlier which were good, but these diaper pants are pathetic. It starts to leak in 4 to 5 hours. The quality is so bad that u can see the colour of the stool! The baby got rashes as well. The seller is either selling a duplicate product or Pampers (P&G) have manufactured a product of very bad quality. Will never buy it again and also suggest others not to buy it."
"I had been using baby dry diapers ever since my lo was born now that she is 13 months old I thought I should switch to pant style diapers, with my trust n loyalty with pampers I opted for the pampers baby dry pants but was so disappointed with them result it gets shifted every now &then and there is leakage always when my baby is sleeping this is irritating me never faced this with Their baby dry range !! Poor absorbency and not at all leakproof and the worst it with due respect for the brand I ordered 4jumbo pack already which has no return policy my bad 👎🏻 Not recommended at all"
Duplicate see my image u will understand
ORGINAL
1.BIG AND GREEN COLOUR (bought from local shop)
DUPLICATE( bought from AMAZONE
1. POOR QUALITY
2. SMALL THAN ORGINAL
3.XL IS WRITTEN BELOW FRONT LABEL
4. HARD THAN ORGINAL
Its not real product. Leaks very fast. I am using pampers since2 years for my baby. But now the last 3 lots was duplicate.very bad quality. I am going to replace pampers with some other brands
The New series of diaper pants launched by pampers are smaller in size as compared to prior ones of same size which were available till recently. They seem to be tighter and are uncomfortable. It is time for pampers to change its motto from one diaper a night to two-three diapers a night.
Material is very good. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
Absorbing capacity is very good.
Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal diapers
Nice product....it gives less rashes as compare to other diapers.
Pamper pants is soft and best diaper to use for new born babies. This product(NB size) is very comfortable for new born babies and it keeps baby dry all night.
I would highly recommend this product.
Tried other popular brands but leakage and comfort is not like pampers. Also on amazon you can get 20-30% discount on MRP which is great thing as in market no discount.
Have been using pampers for my baby from his birth.
Had always doubt about using diapers for small babies as I was scared of rashes.. But thankfully with pampers never had any problems... Baby slept comfortably and I was relaxed too.
Diapers quality is very good and comfortable for my twin daughters. There is no rashes or skin reaction. Absorbs wetness and soft for baby skin. Works for whole night without any leakage. Thanks amazon for fast delivery and pampers for taking care of my daughters.
Best diaper ever for babies. Very comfortable and soft can be use for overnight light weight does not leak.
This product is a awesome... Baby sleeps properly overnight... So much silky and soft.. No leakage and no rashes. I recommend this product just go for it. Great product in reasonable price...and happy with amazon for super fast delivery.
My honest review on this 👍
"M using pampers since my baby 👶 born, & trust me its the best, i mean sometimes i thought go for some different brands available on market, but lastly i can't change my thoughts againsts pampers! 💗 Means pampers all the way! & lastly don't forget to buy it from Amazon .. Great deal!!! Awesome price range! Obviously less from the market :) ❤️"
"My son is 11 mints old and I used this company product for the first time, this Doesn't have any absorbency, gets leak within 4 hours and we need to change the diaper twice in a night......"
Please don't buy it as this is not with random pieces of diapers this is with each diaper in the pack
Really disappointed with the product....
Will never buy it in future and will recommend everyone not to go for it either
Old  was better.  Need to change diaper after two time use. Night diaper will not go till morning... Many times I observed my baby dress full wet because of leaking and bad absorption. I was not expecting this from pamper.
I purchased this for my nephew who is 4 months old. I was happy to see that pampers did not cause rashes to his skin. It absorbs wetness very quickly and does not irritate him. It can carry 3 kg load and still does not sting. Its soft and high quality.
I am really grateful to my friend for suggesting me to use Pampers New Diapers Pants for my baby. Earlier he used to cry whole night due to wetness but Pampers New Diaper Pants helps him to stay dry and he enjoys sound sleep. It keeps the baby free from rashes.
"Very bad diper, I have just used 2-3 diper but not satisfied, if you can see in photo this is material which is out of diper and blow on baby's bump, very bad this time, i hope this complaint will effect because this is for my baby and I will never buy this and also for other."
"I have used pampers diaper brands for my baby ,some brands  are good in absorbency, some are soft but all of them are not comfortable to the baby so after trying so many brands i found out this is very good diaper excellent absorbing capacity and its very comfortable for my baby while sleeping. i am ordering this large pack for about 3 years( of course size has changed since from zero to XL for my baby). also some brands leave marks on your baby skin but this diaper does not have any such problem only key point here is choosing your baby size correctly. it is good for 6-8 hours in an extended run."
Pampers are my first choice for my babies... It is so soft... Totally leak proof... I use them on a daily basis... Full night 12 hours... No leakage... No rashes on my baby's skin... No matter if I use it 24 hours too... No redness no irritation nothing happens.... My baby stays happy happy in pampers....
i am using pampers since 1.5 years. i always order mega monthly box pack of 152. they comes in 38x4=152 total pack. they were of excellent quality.(they use to have extra absorb channel logo on it.  but right now i received in pack of 76x2=152. with logo of air channel. each and every pack licks and don't even last for 2 hours. waste of money so don't buy. if you don't sell the original product you use to have for sale we will have to switch to other brand.
I have been using pamper pants for my 6 months old little one and it's absolutely soft and leak proof. I have tried some other brands before using pampers but I consider it be the best. Pampers contains aloe vera which prevents baby's skin from rashes. Pamper gives us happy and sleep-full Nights. Seriously!!
Pampers is my go-to product for baby diapers. It absorbs well and keeps the baby's/toddler skin dry & rash free. I like it more because it's design is leak proof even for my active toddler. I've used it for my new born too because of the soft touch. Totally recommend it !
it’s a nice pants..! Material of this pants are soft so it’s not causing any type of rashes on baby’s delicate skin. New design of this product has a feature of comfortable fit. Magic gel locks wetness away for up to hours and hours. quality of this product is appreciated.
"These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours."
These pants causes rashes very quickly. I would recommend Pampers active baby diapers or Pampers baby dry diapers instead.
Diaper pants locks moisture with baby's skin and causes rash very quickly n frequently.
"Pumpers is the brand which doesn't need any explanation, easy to use, comfortable on baby skin, no rashes problem, it's keep skin dry overnight. It's Aloevera lotion helps to keep baby skin rash free and irritation free, it's gives up to 12 hour of dryness."
"Pampers diapers are best for kids as they are leak proof ,rash free and comfortable to wear."
They are super absorbent and even if they are full they don’t become become heavy like other diapers.I am happy to finally find perfect diapers for my kid
love these as over night diapers! Even for every day use they're great. They're soft and comfortable for my daughter which makes her happy her being happy makes me happy. Also they keep her dry over night so no waking up because of a wet diaper.
This was definitely very low quality diapers compared to what I usually buy at the shops or other sites. It even looked so fake. The ID code which is printed on the main cover was not present on the individual diapers which led me to believe these were indeed fake Pampers product. It kept leaking every night  and sometimes even after just 2 or 3 hrs.  Will definitely  not re order from Amazon again.
Excellent quality and flexible to baby's movements for comfortable fit.
Easy to wear and comfortable during night because it creates space for air to flow.
It's durability is high and it is soft on skin for a comfortable night sleep.
It's best diaper other than because of aloe vera lotion which protects from skin rash and irritation.
"Absorbance 👍Softness 👍Leak proof👍Comfortably fit👍 as shown in the add, it is actually last upto 12 hours and the Magic gel technology helps to keep baby dry for longer and the best part is lotion with Aloe Vera which protect skin from rashes.."
"If your baby is not so healthy, then this is the perfect fit. Mamypoko pants are a bit wider, hence it creates a problem in walking for the kids that are not so healthy."
"Recently I picked these up and they are wonderful! I wouldn't have thought before I was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praise.They are soft, very absorbent and fits great.These diapers provide up to 12 hours of leak-proof protection & are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortable.Totally love these diapers."
"I am a pampers mom since last 2yrs. The improvements in material, durability and easy-to-use are best in class. The aloe Vera lotion gives extra smoothness to the baby's skin. The airy, soft and easy to tear waist band is a win win. As it is not very tight on babies skin and the easy tear sides help in removing the soiled diaper with convenience."
"New Pampers Baby-Dry pants style diaper I use it for my baby, this product pampers is really good i order this product for my daughter she is approx 18 months old. It is a great product. Material is very soft and important is no rashes, material is very skin friendly. It is comfortable, fit and hugs my baby’s skin. My life is easier because we no longer have to deal with any skin reactions or rashes and my baby is comfortable. Its gel locking system is amazing, it locks the wetness for more than 10 hrs and keep my baby dry entire night. I highly recommend this product."
"My first time purchase for my new baby and I must say, this is one of the best decision I have taken for my kid. Pampers is as soft as a feather on baby's bum even after 12 hours. Yes, it comes out as dry, the pee soaked in, absolutely no smell and there is no skin wrinkle."
"I have 1 baby and I am using pampers  for my baby. It’s really soft and comfortable for baby soft and sensitive skin. One diaper lasts for whole night, no rashes or allergies seen since I am using it earlier and then now ordered just because of well known quality of this superb"
"Diapers are very poor in quality. Absorption capacity is very less. It is leaking in 2-3 hours. It is not the original pamper diapers. Amazon to take action on their sellers who are selling duplicate products. I am regular customer of amazon. Because of this , duplicate product, now I have doubt about amazon. I hope amezon will do the needful to maintain their brand and customer trust."
I have bought Pampers New Diapers Pants first time from Amazon for my nephew and I was totally happy with the bundle conveyed to me. So far I couldn't find any problem. I prefer pampers because any other brand gave a horrible rash. Don’t know why people are giving negative reviews.
I've been using Pampers diaper pants for my kids for a long time and really love how gentle they are on baby's skin. The Pampers are best for night time use and have absorbency upto 7-8 hrs. They have aloe vera lotion which helps in keeping baby's skin soft and rash free! Recommend this for all new borns and babies!
I bought this one for my son and its so comfortable after wear it by son..  very useful as I want for my son.. Good packaging and arrived on time..
Its a very good product and material is skin friendly. I am using this product since long for my baby and till now my baby didnt suffer from or any other skin related issues or any rashesh. This diaper is awesome to absorb the liquid also and gives extra absorption and ofcourse last more than 10 hrs. I am very much satisfied with the product.
My baby is 2 yr old now. Am using pampers from his birth. I have purchased pampers through Amazon many times. But this time am not satisfied with the product I received. It looks like a duplicate. There's some difference in appearance. But it does its job..
I'm a happy mother with pamper diapers because before 8 months I'm blessed with a baby boy. In starting time we didn't use any diapers because I heard from many people that with diaper baby is not feeling good and scared with rashes problem and I didn't sleep whole night with my son wet napy problem. After some time I used many others diapers. But not satisfied with quality as  compared to Pamper Diaper. With use pampers my baby sleep whole night and wake with smile and  i never faced any rashes issues. So definitely I'm happy mother with pamper diaper.
I guess first of all it duplicate and expired product that you are selling bcz 1diaper =1 night nonsense according to me 1diaper =2 hrs that too its leaking and poor quality when compate with poko pants and huggies are much better than pampers
Pampers is the Brand every parents can trust while buying baby product. The pants are so soft and easy to use and remove It make my baby feel comfortable.
It locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it. And there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies. This new upgraded version of the product is really good.
Fresh product according to showing in the description
 i think this one is the best and comfortable for my  little brother thank you  pampers.😀
"Using pamper pants for my kid for last 3 years. Complete satisfaction. Much better than Huggies or mamy poko pants. They hardly stay dry for longer period. But pampers has tested and proven to us, it keeps dry and absorb better."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Pampers , the name says it all.  Its all about pampering  ur baby with wonderful dry pants. Very easy to use and leak proof. They are super cottony and comfortable.. i am a reguĺar user of pampers and trust me they are the best and lasts long. Baby stays so comfortable in them . This brand will never break your trust."
"I have been using Pampers for the past year for my daughter. It's been mostly ok, but lately I have observed that it rips from the back and the absorbent stuff spills out. This is a danger factor as the child could ingest these absorbent particles. The attached picture is after a night of use ~9 hours."
"It never disappoints me. Can rely upon it wherever I take my baby, weddings, doctor visits of crèche. Optimum Absorption and great quality, diaper rash is no problem. The new diapers with aloe vera are quite skin friendly and airy. one diaper lasts through night and there is no leakage in morning. Did not have such great experience with other diaper brands."
"Absolutely Amazing product 👍 I have been regularly ordering these for my 9 month niece. The diapers are really super soft, comfortable and easy to use. 😊 Best part they are leak proof and water absorbency is very good 👍 must buy product"
Good quality 👍 and durability
1. Material is very good.
2. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
3. Absorbing capacity is very good.
4. Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal pamper diapers.
"Do not complete with Pamper premium, but this is very good."
Please do not go for normal pamper diapers because there are lots of complains about its quality.
"Hope this review will help to all of you. Once you use it, you will not find any word of this review wrong."
"We have been ordering pampers almost 3 years. The quality of the material delivered this time is not really pampers. I guess some cheap quality material has been supplied this time. Diaper pant are not soft, durable, flexible etc. Hope this is not repeated and trust we have on Amazon is intact."
"Pampers is a very renowned diaper brand and undoubtedly one of the best. What I liked about these diapers was the soft inner lining so that the baby doesn't feel harsh. Also, one diaper last for around 6-7 hours through the night! The soaking capacity is great! Plus the pants are easy to use and the waist area is very soft so it doesn't create impressions on the baby's skin.  I recommend using these."
"This product is too useful for both baby and mother as it gives relaxation with sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 152 units , each consists of air channels which provides dryness whole night ."
most comfortable product with long lasting leakage free protection for my child.... Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good
"If weight is accounted, the online pampers are very much light and use too less padded material to soak, in comparison to those available in market. I was happy to see the price difference, as online was too cheap, but surely after use, realised the product quality is cheap as well. Might be that I am missing some ** of (condition applied)...or if that is how it is"
Unhappy to buy online.
"These new pampers diaper pants are really amazing! ✅ I bought these for my niece who is 6months old, it fits perfect and is so comfortable. They are made with good material and are really soft 💯 Good absorbency and best part is that they are leak proof. 👍"
used to buy this pampers premium care diapers online as they are low priced compared to store bought ones.. Everytime it starts leaking within few hours of use.. But recently i purchased this same pampers small size diapers in a store for the MRP rate it is of very good quality in fitnesz absorption and softness.. If you are compromising the quality of the product for your discounts then u should inform the customers as such.. This is too bad
We are using pamper pants since day 1.We are so happy to use them for our baby. We don’t have to worry about rashes and my baby as well as my wife sleep full night as there is no tension of leakage too. I would recommend all parents to use pampers.
I have ordered L size daiper pants with 128 counts. I opened the box today and there are  xl size daipers(56) count in box. ...i have ordered many times but all time i received right order but this time cloudtell deleverd wrong size and also less daipers. The total of 112 diapers inside the box. The complete box is waste for me now
"Oh God.. they don’t have a return policy.. while purchasing check for the return policy..  it says for newborns. The baby is a new born and still it’s tight, I don’t know why this is tight for the new borns..  won’t recommend to friends or family and to everyone who is interested in this product."
It is a nice product.. Material is soft so no worry of rash.
Magic gel locks wetness away to keep the baby dry.
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Plz keep on using aloe vera gel that would help protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Would not buy again , I used to buy a popular brand and  I bought pampers  monthly pack for the first time ,  The diaper is elastic  and looks small for a XL size ,due to that air flow is less and creating rashes for the baby.I had to then  go for the previous brand  and I lost my 1000 rs on buying this pampers."
"This product is like Vardaan for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 64 units , each consists of air channels which provides dryness whole night . Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good . I got this delivered in just within 2-3 days . It was nicely packed and sealed ."
Huge disappointment with this online product. Keep leaking
When I buy the same product from shop physically then it's perfectly fine but online product is not good.
Not recommend to buy online
"This is pathetic diaper i ordered till now. My daughter daily wakes up with wet night suit. One day i checked at 3AM, night suit was wet. I used to use pampers active baby, just tried pants as they are advertising it more frequent. But my decision was wrong. I advise all parents to stay away from this pathetic diapers"

It is a great product. Very soft Material so no rashes and no tension too..

Very nice product.i like it.If u wanna think about Best quality diapers its Pampers.. i have used any brands.. but i stand for pampers as it is leak free.. rash free.. soft cotton.. nice material used around waist.. which make baby more comfortable.. love for pampers
Pampers baby-dry pants diapers are with new air channels providing baby a new type of dryness overnight.
These diaper pants are super soft and doest give any kind of rashes also to baby.
Satisfied .
Pampers has been my first and only choice for my son.  It has never disappointed me for my choice.  The daiper is so good and soft.  It stay for good hour with any leakage.  Definitely recommend to all moms for great daiper experience.
"Pampers Platinum Pants’ comes with unique adjustable side tapes. a snug fit provides better leakage protection. I think this exclusive feature to pamper Pants is awesome, considering babies come in all shapes and sizes with comfort"
I'm using pampers for my both babies since 3 years but this time i try
"New pampers premium pants with new, improved cotton like softness.."
It's Wetness indicator is awwsoommee which turns from yellow to blue when it may be time to change.
It also Infused with mild lotion to help protect your baby’s delicate skin from irritation.
"The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too. Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness. best part is Baby lotion with aloevera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation."
"Good Diaper, but it leaves a mark on baby's waist.Elastic is too tight . Company should provide soft elastic, and they should keep it in mind, these products will come in direct contact with babies. Like other diapers, req change after every 4 - 5 hours."
Mamypoko pants are far far better than this
.... My baby got rashes and res skin and itching problem... We returns it immediately
Its absorbing power is not good and in 5 hours only it starts leaking.
"However, it is very soft and good for babies, but if diaper will resist for only 5 hour and will become heavy then it would be very costly."
"Its a fake copy , rashes on baby skin , even the size is not da same as other unit and best part no return policy .. you are selling fake products via amazon .."
I know there is no return policy but i can ask amazon to cancel your fake bazaar.
"I was using some other brand's diaper, but was facing leakage problem and rashes.. so I tried Pampers n I am totally satisfied with the results.. one pamers is enough for whole night.. and no rashes because of aloe vera lotion it contains.. so I am happy with Pampers.."
"Best than other brands out there with more absorbing time, odour free, comfortable leaves no rashes or any sign of diaper elastic and so on. Pretty thin also you wont be able to notice when put clothes on your baby over the diaper. I could not ask for more, peaceful nights for me more than my child."
I have been this product when my baby born. It is very comfortable. Not a single time my baby face my skin issue. Quality is excellent. I have not tried any other product it's so comfortable. Good part is that it's available in all sizes. My baby was underweight when he born still I could get his size Since then I am being a loyal customer for this product. All mother should try and test this product and am sure you will not go for any other product
The Main thing in Pampers is it has Capabilities of Stopping leakage full night . The Soft cotton material which is present and the Pleasant smell is Osm. It's lotion with Aloevera is Amazing it gives parents a good Fresh environment. It's Magic Gel formula Interact more people toward it to use for her child that make it differ from the other Baby dry pants.its in budget for Every Category of parent.
Its too light in weight but baby got so many rashes so i personally dont like it for my baby.
We are using huggies and mamy poco but never felt with such problem.
First time tried best brand pamper but not satisfied may be its only happened with my baby and others satisfied.
My baby was born underweight only 1500gms
And to gain wt it was must to provide him best hygiene
Pampers helped me like a blessing
My mother also remarked
"""Kash humare jamane me hota"""
Thnks to pampers 4 giving me and my baby peaceful nights
Its a myth dat diapers cause rashes
Rashes r caused due to unhygenic way of using it
Before using diapers one should know d process of keeping clean intimate area of baby
"We tried many other brands, premium diapers, pants and what not before we tried this and haven't changed it since then. In case of our baby, regular diapers gave him rashes and pampers premium won't last more than a couple of hours. These pants are comfortable and last the entire night for our 10 months old. But with diapers, always try with a smaller pack before taking the plunge as each baby is different."
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
 
Till now never had the problem of urine leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very happy and impressed with pampers diaper pants and recommend this to all looking out for diapers
When you have twins the diapers are handy thing with this super absorbent and leak proof diapers are life saver.
Also using diapers first thing comes is softness and with pampers you will rest assured the baby is in good condition and stay hygiene and dry
"I have used pampers for my son and now i am using for my daughter. Pampers are soft, absorbent, and leak proof diapers. It prevents rashes and keeps skin softer. And it doesn't get heavier even after use of 8 hrs."
"At first I used Huggies diapers which is more expensive than pampers.but when I get the best offers from Pampers so I bought this item.and I realise it's more comfortable for my baby.it is very good quality , durable and easy to use.and rashes is gone away."
After trying a huge variety of diaper brands I have stuck to this one. Awesome fitting leakage proof and of course no complaints about the absorbency. Also the material is so light that skin can breath easily. Additionally this 144 number packet serves the entire month. But
Awesome product...i was affraid to buy the product online as heared issues of genuine product... when i opened the package i have doubted that the diaper seems bery low weight than i baught from the supermarket. So i tested it by dropping water from the water pipe and it was awesome experience that all the waters were absorbed and there was no leak...
"The best diapers available in the market. With the pleasant aloe Vera odour, pampers outperform compared to other products. Searched a lot on child diapers, and finally i found the fact that pampers is the ultimate destination of all parents to care their little ones"
Pampers xl pants are a good product.
It's has enough absorption to last overnight
And doesn't get too messy even if the child defecates in it.
"Easy to put on and remove, overall a good product with good value for money."
Ever since my baby is born I didn't trust any brand except pampers.  It's so good and I never face leakage problem.  My son is a proud pamper baby.
It even doesn't cause rashes even if used for longer time.
"I have been buying this big pack as they are giving good discounts. But recently I have started watching some negative reviews about this product having quality issues and it's durability. But I didn't face any issues like this. There was no leakage and quality was good, maybe not great but isn't bad too. Maybe it might be one of the case for some people where they didn't get the right product."
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body. My baby is very comfortable in pampers. I will buy it again."
I ordered Pamper diapers for my one year 3 months old son.
"After using so many different brands i recommend this to every parent because pampers diapers designed to keep your baby dry and comfortable. Its super stretchy elastic adapts to the baby’s waist size to give a gentle, comfortable fit. And it provides up to 12 hours absorption for uninterrupted play and sleep time for your baby. "
"Pamper pants are magical pants for 👶 baby. It absorbs all wetness and baby feels so comfort. It is leakage proof, soft and  comfortable. Baby feels dryness, I used it regularly for my baby and I observed that there is no rashes problem. I personally recommended it all moms to used it for all babies."
Pamper pant  quality is very good . Fittings are nice and  very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate. Material is soft which help to  no rashes .its magic gel help dryness 12 hrs leakage free. The brand pamper is trustable. Value of money .
"This diaper is of poor quality. Material is thin and it leaks. Now that we have opened it after two weeks and used four pants so far, I am not returning it but this is waste of money.  Amazon and the seller selling substandard product promoting it as premium product at premium price."
"Diapers are very soft, i love the material and its fits well to my baby, after i started use it on my baby boy he stopped getting diaper rashes, the diaper is best to use in night, very happy with the product...."
recommended...
"Pampers pants is very nice product for baby's. Pampers Pants absorbency is best , 1 night full dry for baby,  it is leak proof because it is made from best cotton,  and nice softness . Overall  best pants for bebys .variant types of pants size like s , m , l ,XL, xxl ."
Good and genuine item received. Bought it several times from Amazon. Price less compared to offline retailers.
Baby boy also seems happy with it!
Good absorbing capacity. We typically need 2 per day.
wow it helped me a lot & saved my shopping time
It was amazing product 😊  very easy to use nd stuff quality is awesome ..
I want to suggest everyone to buy this product for your baby  .... after using this i will shop again tq amazone to provide this product 😊
Nice daiper with high absorbing capacity...
Its very soft than others...
Great deal in comparison of local market.
"Small size does not fit for 3months baby. It only fit for 0-2 months. For above 3months, I would prefer medium size. Ensure the pants are checked n changed every 2-3hours. Although it cover say one pant = one night, babies are unconfortable once the pant is heavy."
"My daughter is 11 months old, recently I used pampers diapers for the first time, and I would like to say,  it is a very good product, it protects the baby from any kind of rashes,  fits quite well around the waist and is leak proof even if baby urinates, or worns it for a longer period. Additionally,  it is very light weighted, softness at its peak and not overly fragranced."
"Cherry on cake is, even after having all these attributes, it is pocket friendly also."
Ordered for my nephew and niece as my family prefers this brand.
Apparently they are very satified with it's quality and absorbancy.
Also got a good price for lightning deal which makes me happier
Pamper diaper pants are very soft. I loved the material and fit of the diaper. The diaper is best to use during night. It keeps dry and also soft for the babies. It's anti leak quality is  what I like the most. Totally recommend to mommies to try this on babies.
It is the best one for babies. It absorption capacity is enough to stay all nigh. My baby wakes up with a smile on his face. It is ssoo soft as baby doesnt cry once while wearing it. I am totally satisfied with it.
Using this product more than 9 months. Earlier it's quality and material was fine but now it's less durable and material quality is of not good quality also new packs seems less authentic. It's more like a scrap now.
"Was using Huggies without any issues. As pampers was a good brand and as it was available for offer, i tried this. But i regret buying this as it is not lasting at all. We have to change the baby at the middle of the night as it starts leaking and make the bed wet. I'd rather leave the baby without a diaper than using this."
Now i am stuck up with this as i have to wait till its over to move back to Huggies.
"I have used Pampers many a times for my baby... This time I ordered large size for her,,these diapers are really awesome 🤗as it makes my daughter comfortable throughout the day.😎... She keeps on playing the whole day without any leakage problem. 👌👌"
I just love pamper diaper and wipes too
With comparison to poko pants  its not great becoz poko pants also a good product for daily use just bcoz of price difference all people can not prefer to use it so i hope to u for give us some offer in small package
I have ordered these diapers for my nephew. the quality of the diapers is really good. It can last for a long time and its leak proof and have a good holding capacity. The size is also comfortable and its soft.
Product quality is very good .
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 4 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable."
Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use.
This diaper brand is the best in the market. I used almost every brands but now I continue with pamper diapers only because it doest not leak very often and my baby feels comfortable all day long with this diaper. Now I cannot switch with other brand .. Thanks Amazon for great deal..
Soft like feather ...Pampers has been the companion for both my kids ...I have been an ardent fan for Pampers since long time ...amazing soaking capacity...and totally leakproof ... so never had those do called sleepless nights ...All thanx to Pampers 😊
"I have bought Pampers diaper for my Son, the diaper is very soft compared to other competitors. The diaper sustain for more than 8 hours and also does not emulate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my son delicate skin. On the whole I am very much satisfied with the quality of the product and also the pricing of it. I would always recommend to go for Pamper diapers."
Pampers as the name is a brand. It's material is really soft and good absorbent. It's fits perfectly to the baby. And easy to remove too. These are really good as they don't cause rashes to the baby.
"Pamper pants is the best diaper that I have been using for my baby. This one I ordered to gift a friend of mine. Pampers pants have the best absorbency, they are leakproof and soft on the baby's skin."
"From past 4 years I am using pampers for by kid,those days pampers are very good for absorbing and now a days ""new pampers"" was very waste product it was not having absorbing capacity and also leaking in the nights.so,please care for kids sensitive skin and maintain the older days quality."
These are our favorite diapers. We tried a different very popular brand but Pampers are better. The baby is dry and feels comfortable. No leaking. Good product and a very reasonable price. Best value for diapers.
"i have been using this particular diapers since it was introduced at amazon...at first i wasnt very much impressed with the size covering the babys bottom...but now i find it the most cost effective,easy to use and available in market"
"This is definitely fake, not even close to the quality of the original. Very thin and not so soft. I think it must be uncomfortable for the child. It was such a cheap Quality, we had to throw them away."
"Pampers the well known brand for baby diapers, I always prefer pampers diapers for my baby, because it's safe and soft for baby's skin, comfortable, easy to wearing and gives full protection. It's my no. 1 choice."
If u wanna think about Best quality diapers its Pampers.. i have used any brands.. but i stand for pampers as it is leak free.. rash free.. soft cotton.. nice material used around waist.. which make baby more comfortable.. love for pampers
"We have a 3 year old who wears this only at night. Even if he doesn’t drink any fluid before. Sleeping, the absorbency of this nappy is not at par with some of the others, even the pampers (same size) available in a different country (UK)."
Comes in very good packaged condition.
There is no leakage issues with these.
Very soft.
Easy to use and wear.
Absorbs very well and quick.
Must have if you have kids.
"Pampers - The best diaper brand in the country. It does an amazing job if you love putting your baby into diapers. The most important feature about Pampers is that it is pant style and its very very lightweight. Just feels like a cloth. Absorbs leakage very fast and keeps the surface breathable and fresh all day. Also new mommies who are in a dilemma about what diaper brand to go for, Pampers is just your thing. Go get it! ♥️"
"Pampers are the best baby diapers which I will prefer to all parents because rest other diapers having some problems like they cause rashes, leakage problem before target time, etc. But Pampers are the diapers which have no complaints from my side,"
"I have being using pampers from the exactly 2 years from the day my baby was born n now she is two and we use it too earlier it was pampers active baby , then pampers premium and now pampers pants , it feels like it’s part of our routine wardrobe for my child it’s easy to use and is easily available in India and overseas"
"Softness, absorbency is good. But it is not leak proof. Many times diaper got leaked and my baby woke up in wet dress, even though the diaper is not full. I have been using this since 4 months (NB for 3 and S for 1), diapers from the recent packet are leaking a lot"
Very Soft and Perfect diaper i found after trying many brands
My Baby had a comfortable with this diaper only
baby Can wear all night no irritation
smells good
easy to tear
Best for new born baby
"I m very curious about cleaning and safety of my baby boy, those are perfect for take all without any leakage."
Softer then i think so no harm to baby
"I have ben using diapers for my kiddo since 3 year now. Earlier I started with using Huggies, but after a friends recommendation, I tried Pampers, and trust me I didn't find any need to switch to any other brand. Material they use feels very soft and gentle to infants. Though, at times, I found toilets leaking when checked in the morning, but these are only at times. Most of the times, they stand up to the expectations."
overall quality is ok.. while many among the pants are coming defective and causing side leaks of urine.. baby is within the prescribed age for the size i am using still he could use it not more than 3 hours and the diaper is either overflown or leaking urine.. i would suggest pampers to look the matter over since parents are finding other brands to be more reliable over pampers..
I have ordered previous packs from firstcry but this time i ordered from amazon.
The diaper was a bit loose.looks like it either very outdated or not genuine however this wasnt the same with firstcry pack..
Waste I used 15 pads.7diapers were leakage.dnt buy my baby 3months old.she is feeling uneasy at nyt times.i wear diapers for my baby nyt times only.upto now I used mamy poko pants it's gud.
Such a nice product with very good soft meterial.
Kid feels so comfortable with it. And it's absorbing is really good.
Overall happy with the product and value for money.
We are using this brand since our child was 3 months old. Absolutely love the sizing and the quality. Absorbency is great compared to other brands and does last the entire night for our medium to heavy wetter.
It is an excellent product. It's absorbance of air channels is wonderful and as well as it is a leak proof and soften to the baby skin.
Good product for babies. I feel other than pampers is the best choice.
This was bought as a gift for my friend who just had her baby and according to her this is a very good product. This was the first diaper that they had used and they aren't gonna switch. It is quite odourless and does a great job regarding the leakproofness. Overall i'd say they seem to be very useful for the price.
I have been using these diapers for my daughter since start and still using when she's 18 months old. These easily last for 4-5 hours during the day and good for overnight usage as well. She has never faced leakage with these. The diapers are very soft and don't cause rashes.
Well the product is simply amazing
Fits perfectly for 4 to 8kg babies.
"If we talk about the absorbing capacity , I would say it's the best in the class and is good for usage ."
If you are looking for one
I'll recommend this product
"My baby is about to turn 2 years,when she turned 3 months old,I ordered pampers and from that ,I switched to these wonder pant diapers.They are very easy to use,saviour when I go out and provide comfort to my baby girl.She is hyper active and these diapers are a best fit for those babies who doesnot need any rest.Also Amazon delivery is the best prime or no prime,they always deliver on time."
"When it comes to diapers, pampers is my first choice for my baby. It keeps her dry for hours without irritation. It's very durable as when on a long day, it can be used for hours. Also, it's wearable and very soft on the skin which prevents rashes to some extent. I am loving my packet of pampers. Will definity buy it again."
I usually buy only Pampers product for my daughter. This time I felt very bad since my daughter experienced severe itching after using this. Used only 10 pads out of 56 pads. Initially I didn't find the cause for her itching later I identified only using this she felt bad.
I didn't expect this from AMAZON ...sorry to say this..
"It's soft and light-weight which is why I liked it very much. Though after use, it becomes heavy within couple of hours."
"I was using it from last 6 months purchase it online first time. Its good and dry, durability according to describe and soft and rushes free. I am using it mostly when we go out or in the night time. Done its job effectively ."
"I thought prime day deal awesome let's buy it and I have ordered it. My order got waste.. First of all the package came open, though not missing count of the pamper. The quality of pamper is not same with the regular pampers which we buy.  Why the difference in the quality. I doubt it is duplicate. I have attached pics of the same for your reference. Please don't cheat people 🙏. Consumer satisfaction should be first priority."
Really waste product to purchase.it is not even lasting for 3hrs for a new born 2months old baby.Urine is not getting absorbed on the front side and back side it's becoming wet very quickly.Apart from changing diapers I need to even change baby clothes very frequently due to this diaper.I will not recommend Pampers.Actually I use mamy poko pants every time but I just wanted to try out this product and it turned out to be worst.
Very soft pants with very comfortable waistline as compared to others  brands no rashes appears after using pampers hence recommended. I have been purchased this 1st time really satisfied. Good quality and long lasting
It is good for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has an air channels which provides dryness whole night . Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good . I got this delivered in just within 2 days.
"When it comes to our children, we have to use the best product which provides comfort and no rashes even wearing after whole night. Pamper is the best brand we can use.. No leakage no rashes. Comfort is more. Recommend to buy..."
I have seen for my baby that the product is very soft & smooth but there should be more absorbent capacity than what it is now. One pamper for whole night is ruled out. I need to change 3 pampers in whole night. My baby drinks some water at  night though.
Recent upgrade in Pampers is not as good as it was used to be having used 2.5 years now for my kid. Not lasting more than 3 hours. Newer model have been using for my kid 4 months now just to see if there the quality is improvising.
"Product is good in quality with an improved design and flexibile waistband. Keeps baby dry for long hours. Only I felt it should have that indicator showing the diaper is full like it's earlier version blue line that turns yellow. Also the elastic on the side lines leave a slight mark on that area. Otherwise it's great in absorbency, softness and feels light as well. My baby sleeps comfortably full night in Pampers pant. 👍"
"Have been using Pampers for baby and have not faced any issues with the product. Amazon offers great deals and subscribing leaves you at peace by not missing out ordering. Material quality, absorption, comfort of baby all of this is taken care."
It is really a nice product i purchased it for my sister's daughter. The flexible waistband is really very adjustable also the softness feels like a ball of cotton so no rashes at all. Approx 12 hours of dryness as well. Happy baby with pampers always.
I have been using pampers diapers for my baby since 1 year but the diapers of this pack are not of good quality n result in very quick leaks. I don't know if the material of the diapers has deteriorated or this stock is defective
"I am use pampers diapers till my child born.. fantastic product.. no leckage, very good quality, good absorption.. after use my child got a sleepy night. Thank you pampers.."
"Being a doctor I have always used trusted brands for my little girl. So for diapering, Pampers has only been my choice from day 1. It easily lasts 5-6 hours in the daytime and 8-9 hours at night. The price is quite reasonable too."
"I am using Pampers for both of my kids.. for elder son also I used Pampers only.. now m using for my new born child also... Even I recommend to all my friends to choose to buy Pampers only.. it's soft, leak proof, have more absorbent power, and moreover comfortable.. u can use night also.. u will not find rashes for ur baby.. baby bump will be soft and safe.. nothing to worry when Pampers are here.."
Pampers pants are not new to me. I like them because of the durability it gives in such a low price. Although material quality is not that much as of pampers premium but I prefer dry pants when I have to use them for a short time or for regular use as it is cheaper than premium pants. So it's value for money and easy to use too.
"Pampers New Diapers Pants, X-Small size,  for new born baby. Very comfortable as well as very soft.  The Quality of the diapers is amazing.  The diapers are leak proof.  The product is full value for money. Best for babies."
Pampers always brings best for babies. Product feel is very soft and definitely comfortable for babies. It absorbs brilliantly. Also size is perfect l. Also leak proof. Quality is also good.
Pampers New Diapers Pants are simply the best.  I ordered these for my niece and my sister love using them.  She doesn't use any other brand.  It's leak free and it's comfortable and easy to wear also.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Recently bought this product, delivered on time and product quantity is nice...Easy to use."
Pampers pant style diapers are best in the market. It doesnt leak in night time. Its quality is also too good for my baby's sensative skin. I always found great deal online in amazon.
Thanks Amazon for the best deals ..
A quality product.
Packaging was good and delivery was fast.
Got a huge discount on Amazon.
Very easy to use diaper pants.
Material quality is also good.
"Hi,"
This time I am very disappointed with pamper .Diaper is leaking in every 3-4 hours.It promises for whole leakage free night.but I wore it at 11  in night and around 5 am it starts leaking .This is too irritating in winters for my baby .
The product is soft...i have ordered the monthly pack and strangely Iam getting the problem of leakage from the diaper after  half an hour... I don't know why it is so... I have used this product earlier but facing this problem for the first time
I just received  pampers and i tried wearing on my baby. It fits well and comfortable on my 1 month's baby.
"It is so soft , so no chance for rashes."
Also there is no leakage found .
so Great and nice product.
Worth buying this product
"I have brought it for my sister child and after using it .I was very much satisfy with the product .lotion of aloe vera in diaper make it smell very good.This new Pampers diapers are no dout better than huggies.As its does have any leakage, hours of hold with a soft grip that will not disturb the baby.i was really impressed with the liquid retention of the nappy and the flexibility of the material."
I tried Pampers this time for my 1.5 yr old baby. With pampers he was so comfortable.  Pampers is soft for babies skin and M size was the right fit for my baby. Very soft & comfortable diapers with aloevera that protects baby skin from rashes and dryness.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit

"t is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too.. Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body Flexible waist band that adapts..."
Im a mother of a 15 months baby and till date i have used all the diaper brands and i have foud pampers to be the best... Its soft for my babies skin and its 100 per cent leak proof..
"I have tried 4-5 brands of diapers but I must say Pampers have never disappointed me. These pant style diapers are very easy to use and dispose, are very soft for babies and leak proof."
I am using pampers product for 3 years for my kids. My 2nd son who is only 9 months old got rashes and itchings on thighs and back after using this pack for last 1 week. Stopped using it and went to hospital and using medicines. Never faced this kind of issues with other sellers. Very bad quality from this seller. Extremely dissatisfied...
"This is best diaper I found it for my baby , no leakage ,till now no rashes problem gives a comfort to baby"
"Not orginal product.. they are cheating us with duplicate pampers,, in a box my u found 10 pics of orginal pamper.. remaining duplicate..."
The worst baby dipper in the market now..
"Pampers is my favorite brand when it come to diapers for my kids. For both my kids am using Pampers. They are soft, leak proof and stays for long.. can hold 2-3 pees . My LO remains rash free"
"Pampers is the brand where every mom can trust blindly. I am using the same brand for kid from last 10 months. And this is really soft, leak proof. My baby enjoy his night without any rashes and leakage."
Pamper dry pants gives a comfortable  fit to the babies. Diapers are very soft  and gives comfortable night sleep.  Magic gel locks the wetness and keeps babies dry for long time upto 12 hours.. Love for pampers
I don't know how pampers is the doctors choice it's really bad... Even it leaks swell as it is very thin i bought L size... Before I was using himalaya it is the Best.... My worst experience with pampers diaper. Never ever buy it again
"Very soft material, thus comfotable for baby. No leakage whatsoever. Absorbs well."
Easy to put on baby as in pants style. Would definately buy again and recomend to others
Because of low price I bought this product online.. But I guess it's a fake product...or duplicate product.. My baby  got rashes and everytime I see it's cotton like material get stick to my baby's skin.. Pathetic..
I buy it regularly but this time the whole set was very bad quality. It tore everytime I made my kid wear it. Tore from the sides hence had no option but to throw it out.
"Bought this after recomendation of our friends and it’s worked well for us. Our son sleeps straight overnight so it’s was important to have diaper that we don’t need to change for 10-12 hours. Very soft ones and very tiny, hence very absorbing. It’s really worked well for us. Will order more"
"Have been using Pampers for my baby from day 1. It is the best. No leakage and other complaints in past 2 years. Have used other brands but have not liked the quality. In this price, it is the best!!!"
"I have been using lots of diapers but nothing stands out, but after using this diaper there is no looking back. Used this as a whole day and even at night no issues at all. Soft and light"
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 6 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable..I always buy"
Pampers diapers from Amazon because it give great and best discount possible.. without any second thought go for it.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit.
"It is written on the package that 1 pampers=1 dry night which is completely misleading.  Pants doe not sustain for more than 3-4 hours and it is very frustrating for parents as we expect that the kid will sleep for a decent time period but due to the poor quality of the product,  it gets up in a very short span of time."
Poor quality.
Not durable.
Wastage of money as I bought monthly pack.
Very tight on baby skin..  she is 51/2 kgs so i bought small size pant. But pant is very tight for her skin and getting marks/rashes because of that.
I tried pampers premium too. Feels wet when we touch outer layer normally and not a good product. Leaking alot.
Worst
"awesome product for children's it's softness and aloevera lotion technique helps to protect skin and keep it fresh, it contains airchannels and magic gel that makes dry and light it absorbency is too good for childrens,it's leak proof these all specialty makes it awesome."
"Though it says Large in Size, it doesn't hold much, the Product delivered recently was very low in quality and looks very thin in size too. We using for our 11 Months kid out of 10 initially used 3 diapers Crystal gel participial came out."
"Earlier batch was thick in size and quality was good, that is one reason we Opted it again, but this time, it is very bad."
This is very safe for child and this is light weight we can easily wear for our child and our baby wear this is and enjoyed night sleep and baby can also enjoyed pamper smell very good and fresh and this is leak proof and very comfort I suggest for every mother purchase this pamper for their baby....
"The diapers that come from the market and the diaper that I have bought from Amazon, there is a lot of difference between its qualitiy is very low"
Tried Pampers pants for the very first time as I got it at an very effective & reasonable price on Amazon during Great Value Days... My son feels comfortable with this diaper as it fits him well... Glad to buy it... Thanks Amazon & the seller for giving a value product at a very reasonable price... :)
"Really helpful product,  it's very useful for the baby at night and when we are taking baby with us on a trip or taking them outside. It quickly absorb any liquid and it's properly fitted so it's leacproof:)"
Now a days lots of Diapers brands available in india but pampers is one if the best. its very comfy. your kid will love to use. its very easy to use. and very comfortable for daily usage.
I bought this diaper for my baby boy. And I am pretty much satisfied with this product. Absorption quality of pampers is really good.
I let my son wear pampers every night so that he can sleep a full night without getting up.
"Tries Pampers 1st time instead of others,"
Pro-
1. Light weight
2. Soft in touch
3. Elastic is of good quality
4. Fits perfectly
Con-
Buy a large size from usual
The product was delivered very fast thanks Amazon.
Pampers are always better than Huggies. No leaking issue with good absorbtion. very soft material with alovera protection
Leaks too frequently.absorbing power is less.
To belive me ...just compare same size diaper from market with the online one.keeping on for long duration leads to rashes.
Compromise with health.
This is leak proof and easy to put on the baby.
Lasts couple of hours but the duration is dependent on baby activity.
Comfort can't not comment and my baby won't say 😂🤣😂🤣
"I brought this for my little one , and they absorb really well."
Thank god now i can sleep during night with little or no stress of thankging the nappies of my new born.
This is very soft ans gentle for skin.
It is effective for 5-6 hours.
I can not imagine my life without these pempers . It really has sorted my life.
I highly recommend this to everyone.
I bought this because most often people are recommending this brand only..but after using this I got to know why people are actually recommending this because it has a good absorbance power and so soft that baby never get rashes of using this even after using for an entire day. .
A quality product.
Packaging was good and delivery was fast.
Very easy to use diaper pants.
Material quality is also good.
I will recommend to go with this Product
"I absolutely love Pampers and I use Pampers diapers since my baby's birth! The softness, the absorbancy, the convinient design are just so perfect. Can't even think of trying any other brand. I recommand Pampers strongly."
Easy to use as I am using for my kid and never felt any problem. Pamper doesn’t sacrifice their quality. Used other companies diapers for kid but chose back pampers because of its quality. Moreover and most importantly I observed my kid is more relaxed during night while sleeping wearing Pampers diaper than others.
"The first time I used for my son. The urine seeped out of the diaper. The diaper did not absorb. the diaper is supposed to leak only if full, this is not absorbing at all. This pack is the new aloe lotion one. Never had this problem with mamy poko pants..."
Money wastage product and want to return.
The pamper diapers are cottony soft from inside and protects babies skin from rashes. The pant style diapers are easy to use. Even my husband was atmost comfort while changing them from day 1. Our Daughter is a Happy Baby with pamper diapers as its leak proof and absorbs upto 4-5 hours. One pamper One whole night.There isn't a leak even if we go for longer hours without changing the diaper.
Happy Baby Happy Muma!!!
As we Are used always use pampers baby dry pants from starting beacuse its quality is olwys gud..with better absorbency and leak proof so its jst awesome...
From the day we start to use it for baby then its jst gud...
And above all it truly is a premium product at a very reasonable cost..we must say to ol aremts to use this product and then review..
Received a totally soiled packet.....Seemed to have been dipped in some green liquid detergent..
The diapers inside are also all green and are becoming frothy on coming in contact with water....Just cannot be used for the baby....Have to throw the entire pack as there is no return policy....Will never buy this ever
I am buying pampers for past 2 years for my baby and we were satisfied with it. But This time we have ordered new pampers XL diaper pants and we found that its thin and leaking too. Baby have got slight rashes and it looks slightly tighter even though he is only 13 kg. We are now not satisfied with it and planning to buy other brand diaper
My baby now is 9 months old she started using this product when she was 1 month old..material quality is superb & durability up to 12 hours and really it's easy to use...my baby feel comfortable.
Have been using this product for my baby since birth but this time what I have received is worst product ever it changed a lot by design n colour my baby is not comfortable as before. Developing rashes n redness. If some one find change in d product just return n look for regular one.looking for return options but not found.
100percent safe in comparison to other diapers....I only use this one...no diaper can challenge Pampers....no leakage...baby area remains dry 12 hrs....ty pampers
As usual the product reached me within the stipulated time period and I am happy about it.
"The quality of pampers is making me worry,  when it was worn by kid the back port gets aligned to one side."
This creates the option of diaper malfunction which may result in wetting of bed.!
I am facing this problem with the XL Size and this is my 7th pack of 56PCs i have bought.
It has very good absorbency.
"However, not as soft as the Pampers Premium pants (but the premium pants have average absorbency)."
"Overall, really good diapers."
"I have been using pampers diapers pants since my baby was 2 months. The product is amazing, the quality is exceptionally good the smell is very pleasant. The diapers are super soft n highly absorbant. The diaper pants are easy to wear to the baby n easily removable. My baby has never experienced skin redening at the waist line or near the thigh area. Extremely comfortable diaper pants"
We are using Pampers for our twins starting from their birth till date. They are now 1 year old.
We have them in Pampers 24x7 and found it very useful and time saving to clean if not used.
Most importantly it never caused rashes so far.
A very good product !!
I have been using pampers from day 1 since birth uptil now when my son is 10
Months. I have never had any episodes of leak ( thankfully!) and all because of the amazing quality of pampers brand! I have not had any instance of diaper rash as well till now. Will definitely recommend.
I have been using Pampers for my child outside India too and find that the sizing is somewhat smaller here. Absorbency is ok but it's not that leak proof.
"From some time, I have been feeling that the quality standards have been compromised by this company. Needs to improve and get back to its original quality"
"I have been using same product from last couple of month, I have bought first time from amazon product is not upto the mark. Quality of product is totally different from previous one. I ordered L size but it is same as M size not in bigger in size as well as absorbency of product is too low."
I request everyone to not buy this product from amazon or same seller.
i dont know what is the difference with this pamper n other pamper. but this is a fakke product. no durability no absorbing power. its started to leak from side if baby pee more than 3 or 4 times. worst product that i ever lay my hand on amazon.
The product came in a great packaging. Was satisfied with the delivery servise..the product was of good quality ..easy to use..  coukd have been better in softness category.. the diapers had a rough papery texture which was i feel not so good to the baby's tender skin.. overall happy with the amazon service...nice offer... Pretty cheap compared to the local market price... Satisfied
This product is very baby friendly n safe.
No rashes and  no Smell.
Its  very soft n due to leak proof & absorbancy it gives night long protection.
awesome baby product.
my baby is too happy in wearing it in comparison of other diaper where he feels irritated and sad with rashes on. Thanks to Pampers and Amazon which send me every or alternate month as required
"After using Pampers diapers pants for my daughter  I never bought any other diaper brand. It’s so soft, rashes free, no lickage over night, keeps baby skin dry, easy to wear & remove. Awesome . Leek proof and soft."
Bought the large pack for my lil one..but I think the product is not genuine..it gets filled very soon and doesn't last for the night..even it ruptures at times which is unusual for a diapers..I recommend not buy the product online as it is available in the market for the same price..I won't buy it from the seller again
Plz dont buy this product..it leaks very easily and can take upto two urine only.My baby who is 3 months old cannot sleep at night as the bed becomes wet all time..as well as it holds moisture and wetness inside also..Not recommeded..total waste of money.
Most of the diaper pants are leaking just after 5-7 minutes. Hv been using this product for children since 7 months. May be a defective lot been delivered to me
Yes I use so many brands of Diapers for my baby but the pampers diaper pants are always the best. Its Absorbency capacity is very good. And it's a leak Proof and having cotton like Softness....
Pampers has been my go to brand ever since I started buying diapers. I love how trim it is and how soft and stretchy the elastics are. The absorbency is great too. Truly a value for money product.
"This is a world class product by P&G. This is leak proof, softness, and able to absorb 10 to 12 hours. Best thing this is comfortable to use. On price concern AMAZON is better than other omline site and market price. Thanks."
"I BUY MANY PAMPER PACKETS FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND COUNTRIES,BUT IT IS MY BAD DECISION TO TAKE IT FROM AMAZON. WORST AND NOT VALUABLE FOR MONEY,THIS DIAPER LEAKS & MANY TIMES MY BED WET.I NEVER EVER PLAN TO BUY THIS FROM AMAZON,YOU BROKEN MY BELIEVE,SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE OPTION TO RATE BELOW 1 STAR OTHER WISE I WILL PUT -5 STAR."
One of the best and best products for my lovely & honey baby.
"No matter how I define it, it is complete."
But it was delivered too late.
I hope to deliver the next order on time.
"I started using pampers for my newborn, but then moved on to other diapers in order to decide best for my child..i have used almost all the diapers available in india but no1 stands up to pampers....one diaper last thtoughtout night....its gentle on baby's skin,easy to wear and remove...doest leak or stinks unlike other diapers..i recommend it all new parents."
"The pampers pants are very reliable n easy to use. As previously i was using other pants for baby, i found difference that pampers are best for baby. Didn't got any issue of leaking. Most important thing, in morning it doesn't emanate bad smell. It has very good elastic,it doesn't leave marks on baby's waist. Pampers is best from all sides n i am happy with it."
The absorbancy of pampers is really good. And its leak proof as compare to another brand. It is soft and it's smell is really good. Nice idea for aloe vera type of smell. You can sleep without tention.
"An amazing product from amazing brand. These diapers exactly fits my baby of 8 kgs and keeps my baby dry through out the day. My Baby is free from rashes now due to these diapers. Earlier, i have tried many brands but none of them solved the issue of rashes and leakage. Pampers is best for children."
"Soft,  Absorbent product.  My kid move freely with this soft product. good quality and affordable price with leak proof metirial. Thank you amazone again for prompt services."
I think these daipers are duplicate or defective
They are leaking and they are like tissue papers.
Totally Waste of money
Good for nothing....
Don't buy these from online....
One star because it's not possible to give zero star
"Pampers became too commercial, priduct is so slim and bo matter inside onetime child got urinated immediately getting full... dont buy this worst pampers, compared to this Mamy poko pants are so better and cost also less..."
I have been ordering pampers from long time for my child. This order that I placed the quality is poor. We used to use one diaper for 8hrs during the night however this one doesn't last even for an hour. It looks like these are duplicate or fake which the seller is selling & Amazon should get this checked on a serious note as our child's health is at stake.
"i have been using mamy poko pants for my 18 months old daughter since her birth, i dnt know why i ordered pamper this time i m highly disapointed by the product. soaking power is very less compared to other daipers."
"Diapers with great padding, secure tabs, and a shape that held up well under pressure — so convincing to both of parents and we switched to pampers, my child gets a great sleep with these diapers and he is extremely comfortable after wearing this."
Very good performance is thatthese
So that we are happy to use your all product our family is your customer we are looking at your products having the experience with my family and happy to use these things like your product have the good sleep with my children thanks for your kind consideration of this message please
given reply me know when you can do the needful

"Pamper pants has less absorbing capacity, it leaks very bad quality"
Loot macha Rakha he es brand new
Don't purchase
Good Product but leaks in night long sleep baby
Product  quality is good
Gel forming technology is good
But During night use
Baby clothes got wet due to leakage
I got 69 diapers in the pack which is so shocking. we usually don't count diapers but this time I was transferring the diapers in a drawer and I was so so so shocked. Not expected from such a brand
After 2 hrs of usage or when baby plays much then there is link like material seen on baby's skin and also on outer aspect of diaper. This i observed when i changed from medium sized diaper  to larger one. There isn't any leakage problem or rashes with pampers since first usage.
"Its very disgusting that duplicate products are sold through Amazon that too infant & child products,"
Since last 4 months we are facing the same issue of leakage & not a single diaper is leak proof
"Its trust breaking that even after so many reviews from users Amazon is still selling this product , but now we have decided to switch to some other trustworthy source"
I am using Pampers from last one year but from last few months I am facing product quality issue.
After 1 pee diaper gets fluffy. I checked the diaper was too much fluffy and she was completely wet. It seems as product quality is not coming good or seller is selling duplicate product. Highly disappointed. . 😣
Pamper pants are best and comfortable fit for baby and it creates air flow inside which makes them more comfort during night.
It protects baby from skin rash and irritation because of its softness and lotion with aloe vera.
I was using other companies product because it was chip but i turn back to it because it suited my kid from discomfort ness.
"A really. Good diaper for babies. Really convinient to use and good absorption capacity. Love the softness of the inner material, so my baby feels. Comfortable all day long. A must buy for babies daily needs"
"Good Absorbing,but not soft...Like paper only...softness is zero...Better Go for Premium care pants .. I changed to Premium care, that is so soft for babies 100 percent..."
"First of all it absorbing capacity is amazing, very soft on skins, Not even single drop will not get leaked....one of best diaper i have purchased....recommended to all"
One night diaper it is. No leaking at all. And my baby never got rashes to using pampers at all. I would love to recommend all the mommies out there pampers for baby.
"Best ever product. I m using it since two yrs, no complaints. Soft material that means no rashes. Baby feels comfortable whole night, no tension of diaper changing"
"Before my baby girl's birth, I had bought other brand's diapers. But after use there was need to change because of its absorption. There was little leakage. So went out on a medical store and and ask him about and got a suggestion of Pampers. Then take only 5 pieces. It was too good than earlier. Then I ordered via Amazon. Thanks both Amazon and Pampers."
"I am using Pampers since my child's birth. And trust me haven't yet faced any issues.. Most importantly no rashes at all, no leakage.. Pure comfort for the baby and the mother as well. We don't even need to worry if we can't change them and have to keep on the same diaper for a longer time. There will never be rashes. So be rest assured. I trust this product completely."
This is the most amazing diaper available in the market and very economical too. It's very soft and ideal to be used all night long without disturbing your baby's sleep.
We are using pampers diaper pants for last one and half year for our baby. This is the first time I made online purchase. Low quality product is supplied when compared to local purchase. Minimum 2 out of 10 diapers are very very poor in quality. They are leaking just after midnight.I never faced this kind of problem when I purchased in local market...
Baby diapers pants having Gentle absorbing capacity and they're preventing wetness to overflow the diaper pants or over-pants or cloths.
A lot of time saving and maintenance free for a day long
"Soft, easy to wear and comfortable fitting"
"The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this."
It's fake. Poor Quality. New pampers air. Bought 128's pack. In pics it's shown as 64*2 pieces but it's 32*4 what I got. Leaks within 2 hours.. Not Good at all.. Twitted to P & G how to differente new original from fakes ones. No reply.. Seems all promoting fake ones. So buy it.
It locks wetness for 12 hours. The biggest thing is that my child is comfortable wearing it. After start using this my child do not have rashes. I am satisfied with it.
A good product which gives maximum absorption. It is so soft that there's no rashes. Baby sleeps quite peaceful without waking up in the midnight.
It is one of the bestest brand for pampers for babies... I ordered this for my granddaughter as she feels comfortable in it and sleeps so nicely and specially at night
I have been using Pampers for my new born and they were really good.
But I recently shifted to Pampers pants and they are terribly bad. I initially thought that I might be using it wrong but later realized that the product itself is not good. It gets leaked easily and does not stay for long.
Not at all convinced with the product.
Would not recommend.
Brilliant product specially for night it really works wonders keepin the baby dry .It is really soft on the skin n doesn’t get rashes I jus changed from m to l fr more comfort n it very comfortable
"There is definate difference between Amazon supplied ptoduct and shop purchaged product. Ehen the child pees, the amazom supplied pampers leaks the liquid from sides. This does not happened on the regular shopped  pampers. I suspect the product supplied on Amazon the substandard."
"Absorbency,leakproof, and softness"
I have put my baby on diapers since childhood and i feel pampers to be the best and pampers premium is even better. I have tried other brands as well n highly recommend pampers
Good product.
Fast delivery
"Only dont understand why in few pcs the diaper use to leak without getting full,"
 also in one case the diaper inside material came out and sticked to baby's skin.
Keeps the baby dry all the night. Baby feels comfortable and mommy feels safe for the baby ;) i liked the product and i recommend for the babies. Pants style nappy is very easy to wear.
Using this from day 1 for my baby. Happy n satisfied. Coming straight frm a mom... Thanx Pampers fr keeping my baby dry through night's. Timely delivery by amazon
"The pads are a decent fit however the better absorption will give more comfort. For special child, needs of the child can be looked upon before buying a particular size."
I've ordered variety of brands but found these the best ones amongst all. The bigger package costs lesser than smaller ones. I'd recommend this.
"Best ever product. I m using it since two yrs, no complaints. Soft material that means no rashes. Baby feels comfortable whole night, no tension of diaper changing. No leakage with Magic gel and air channel keeps baby skin breathable. Fits very comfortably on my baby's  skin. Thank you pampers."
I already read so many negative comments but the product is original and good quality if you use as per the guidlines it will not make any rashes sometimes it will be allergic to your baby because each baby is diffrent and also delivery was in proper time but package was satisfactory if it was in a cartoon box it will be excellent
Why the company like this shows this typ of cheapness..i brought it on summer sale they give me such a wrost product ever.it does not absorb urine atleast one time.its look like a paper no softness.this is my 2nd purchase in amazone.1is ok.discount means sending this typ of quality less product.totaly fed up do not show this typ of cheapnes again.dont buy..😈😈
"Mostly dislikes: getting filled very fastly, i.e., looks storage is too less."
Also size is less compared to other old medium size pampers.
Besides that product quality is too low.
This diaper is very reliable . Absorbency is too good that is not left may impression . Easy to use diaper. Elasticity is too good so must buy for your toddler .
Pampers is my all time favorite brand when comes to diaper for my baby. It is leak proof soft easy to use and throw. Highly recommend this pamper.got this in just 2 days delivery was also v fast
"Diaper quality came down, we thought diapers design and quality might have changed. Diapers got exhausted before subscription date and we need to get from outside. We got one set xl from dmart and the quality is so good which we used to get earlier from amazon. But now whatever we r getting from amazon doesn't see to be original"
"The product is of worst quality even not usable. Pampers looks like collected from here and there and packed. See the pictures attached. One pamper is totally opened, color changed like wet in some liquid etc.  I purchased from amazon many times but this time it’s Totally frustrating and worst quality."
I recieved fake product. Diaper size looks small but labelled as XL. Without noticing I used some diapers and found elastic marks on baby. .. waste of money. Issues with seller. Amazon please respond on my issue.
Regards
Lavanya
This product us amaze.its absorbancy power is absorbancy power is awesome...its leak proof. its make baby comfort.there is no side affect if this.its veery soft. I recommend this product.
These are pants and quite often leaked from the sides. I have been using another pamper brand with Velcros which are much better for upto 6 month olds.
"Worst experience with the product, as the diaper contains aloevera it caused irritation to baby. Couldnt use it at all. Had used other diapers from Pampers which were good  so purchased this. But this is not good"
"I ordered XL size  Pampers in amazon. However the product quality is very different from the ones i have been using for a year for my son. I read lot of negative review before placing my order, but as the overall rating was good hence I planned to give a try. This product is 100 percent fake. Don't buy this product."
I use to regularly purchase pamper diaper from amazon but this time quality of product given to us was not good.. Even if baby wear for an hour.. It get rashes near lower area.. I doubt product given was genuine or not...lesson learned.. Buy from any super market rather than online.. Where u don't know whether they are giving genuine products
Nice diaper pants which fits my baby really well..m happy with the product..no leakage problem..using these diaper pants from last 1 year and totally satisfied with pamper pants.my baby sleeps throughout the night
We use this product for a long time. It easy to wear. Children dont have any issue related to rashes. Material of diaper is good. Work for long time efficiency.
"I am using product for my baby from day 1 since she born. I have never tried with other diaper. Because this is no 1 doctor recommendation pampers diaper, which feel baby very relax without any harm. It feel very comfortable for baby at night time with out any leakage. I am happy to use this product past 8 months."
Worst Pants ever used. Cant even hold pee for just 2 hours.
"Huggies, Pampers are loosing their mark of trust."
I'm using Little Angel diapers which when compared to Pampers and Huggies dont even match. Super Bad quality
2 Pampers + 2 Huggies = 1 Little Angel Diaper in a night.
"Really good product, leak proof, good absorbecy. Price is also reasonable and i would definitely suggest for this seller as the delivery and packaging of product was also damn good."
Amazing Quality material and very smooth so baby very comfortable with this diaper and main advantage of this diaper is leak-proof so baby sleep without any disturbance.
It's useful one for infants; but durability and softness compared to market available same material is different; when i ordered through amazon it seems little harder one
"Very soft, hygienic, absorbecy product.."
And yes overnight used no leakage..
Leak proof diapers from pampers.
Very nice product for babies...
Don't buy air channels..it's poor quality..easily get leaked within 3 to 4 hrs..don't wear it for your baby while sleeping.. waste of money..very cheap quality..earlier with extra absorbed is very good and comfort for babies..now they changed the quality so don't buy it better buy some other..I was used for more than one year..now I stopped to buy pamper..
"its getting wet in 1 hour, leaking all the time. my daughter cant sleep due to wetness."
pathetic product don't buy its a duplicate not original.
i have bought pack 74 and its of no use now. i cant even return it. waste of money.
"Have tried many brands for my little one but only pampers did the job at its best. Absorbed very well & gave all night protection for heavy wetter too. No change of leakage. Even if your little one poops in it when you are out, you can be assured to reach home safely without any leakage."
Diaper has super absorvency and keep the baby sleep sound whole night.It didn't create any rashes on my baby bump too .It s very delicate to baby skin.loved it
I always found Himalayan a better choice than pampers or any other brand...  As baby have rashes with this...  I buy this because at that time Himalayan was not in store...
"In my openion,this is very good diapers pants comparison to other diapers pants  because the pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin & Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation.I recommend to every one."
Pampers diapers are my first choice . They are very soft and easy to use . The soft touch of diapers helps to sleep kids properly in night . Will Definitely recommend this to parents
I don't like this product. Earlier I was using Pampers extra absorbant. That is too god. It is very thin and everthing comes out of it. It leakes easily even after few hours. And pampers extra absorbant stays long than this. I never recommend this product to anybody for use.
Pamper is very poor quality when we compare to other diapers..
It has very low absorbency
Low quality of material
Mamy poko is cheap and the best...
"After using several brands, I would recommend it for newborn babies. The other diapers were all leaking from the thighs while this doesn’t."
Diaper & package seems to be different. Not the regular one & costing less. Not found the similar one @ Pampers website. Creates suspection on originality. Decided not to procure next time
Leakage and white spots sticking on my daughter’s skin ....I used other brand but this time I tried pampers...But it’s third class product
"The product got delivered on 11 July 2019, and all the diaper end on 01 August 2019."
Recommend not to buy. Cant say its fake as all the bar code where ok.
"Wasted money on this product, will never buy again."
MamayPoko Pants Standard and Huggies diaper are much more worthy then pamper.
Rating will be -10
"Being a new mom, had so many suggestions for diapers. But we opted for Pampers right from day 1 for our daughter. Now she has turned one and a active toddler. I use the pampers which are very comfortable in summers as well and absorb well and are leak proof considering the baby is running around, sitting and active most of the time. Totally satisfied."
"I’ve been using Pampers dry pants for my baby ever since she was born. These are very soft & leak proof . Easily last upto 12 hrs & adhere well to the sizing according to the weight. I’ve a subscription service from Amazon , which really works well for us. Moreover, Amazon prices are unbeatable."
Each and every diaper was leaking. I use diapers at night only. So when he woke up his bottom area was all wet as well as bed. So much disappointed. I bought a monthly package so much discomfort aroused due to this kind of defective product. This has happened with me twice. Never want to buy it again. This time i bought huggies diapers
Worst product ever used for my baby.
It does not absorb well because of which diaper gets wet very quickly.. had to change in a gap of 1.5 hrs to 2 hours. Also the elastic is too tight and causes discomfort to baby and leaves elastic marks on skin
I receive this product Today. I am Fully happy with Amazon service. This product is so soft and easy to use. It helps baby to take tension free night. I am so happy for this type of product for baby skin. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and relatives.
"I bought a monthly pack, it was a very worst diaper product, my baby feels wet very quickly and its leaked and wet my baby’s pant everyday he woke up at morning. They told that it has 12 hours protection its not after 2 hours itself it looks like very wet. Don’t buy this product. Totally disappointed about this product."
Such an excellent product..Leaks only when diaper gets super full...My baby felt comfortable wearing it.No itching or rashes... It work very well.. Easy to use and good quality.. Well packed..
This product is duplicate.... It is very thin and leaks ...every time I ordered from Amazon and I  get different kind of diapers.... First time they were great but  last two times they are not good as per my expectations ...they sold cheap product and name it as offer...
"New product leads to leaking very often. Earlier product i.e. non ""air"" was far better."
Been using pampers for both kids hence associated with the brand for long time.
I will give only 2 star to this product ..actualy this one very diiff from the old pampers ...it does
"Not have any absorbing capacity,at night time it gets more leaky ...baby is not comfortable....i will not recommend to buy this new pampers diaper pants"
"Earlier I used to purchase huggies diapers for my baby but when my freind recommended me this, I thought to give it a try and when I used it I was just amazed to see how rashes from child vanished"
"Not usefull at all.. Pampers have played it very smart.. They previously had 'Active Baby' which was good, but the removed it and brought 'Baby Dry' which is not at all useful product as it leaks most of time and it does not last long. Then they introduced new range Pampers premium which is double the price. Smartly played to make sure new and costly product sells in market."
It is seeming fake.
getting filled too fast.plastik material is almost like paper. pack had 20 packets totally wast .my money just got wasted. This product is Expaid date.very bed product .
I just love it . Attracted me a lot .. am just using it now .. really it's so soft and easy to use . It absorbs and no leakage.. my son sleep well at night
1. Package:- 03/2019....(5-month old)
2. Delivery time:- within 2-days
3. Absorbency:-Good but not good as earlier time..
4. Leak proof:- Better (not best)
5. Softness:- Satisfactory
"I have been using Pampers diapers for my two kids for around 4 years now. The new Pamperswith air channels is the worst quality.Diaper leaks in no time, doesn't stay without leaking for one night. Simply a big failure of cost saving attempt."
Thr new model Air doesnt hold more than 3 pees.. I feel the product is manufactured such a way that it doesnt hold more than 2-3 pees so that we can change on frequent basis and product sells more.
Very soft and comfortable.leak proof diapers. Long lasting and rash free pants . I got these diapers at affordable price..happy to have this product.
"This product is nice with the fragrance, packing but it is filling within 3hrs"
It is the main problem i arised
Due to this wearing my baby starts crying all the time till it removes
But thanks to Amazon service
Whenever i used to say this problem they respond within minutes
But thanks to amazon for responding without fail
"I have been using pampers more than one year but this new pampers are worst. Toilet always leaks and dresses of baby becomes wet. One day microfiber from diaper leaked completely and attached to baby skin, I was scared by seeing those all over baby body. I do not understand whether pampers is selling cheap quality diapers or mistake is from Amazon seller."
I received Duplicate product.
"I have used this product earlier, but this only looks like duplicate of the original product. The material quality is poor and it's very thin. I don't know wether pampers has compromised with quality or wether its a fake material.I don't know how Amazon sells without product check.."
"Very much satisfied with the product because absorbency is good, leakage issue is not there, didn't leave rashes on baby's skin and cost effective price."
"I am using Pampers since birth of my baby and it never disappoint me..the quality is good, size as per age is apt, MOST IMPORTANTLY it suits for my baby's skin..no rash or whatsoever is noticed..it is really a good product..hope Pampers will maintain this.Ty"
Very worst quality.  Please don't buy. The absorbe pad is very thin. It lasted for 2 to 3 hour only. It's quality is totally different from other Pampers diapers available in market. Amazon official  should check the quality of the diapers before selling such low quality materials. Quitly disappointed.
"I have been using Pampers pants from past one years for my 2nd baby,  earlier i have used it for my elder baby for almost around 3 years.. My experiance wrt pampers is like i cant go without it since it keeps my baby dry and comfortable the whloe day and night. Capacity of soaking is high, and there is no smell even after longer use. Cometely satisfied."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit.
"Tried all brands for my daughter and was stuck to this one. Pampers diapers are undoubtedly the best ones in the market, presently. They stay dry for long and are absolutely soft on the baby's skin. Easy to out on and off without much hassle. I recommend them to all the mothers."
One of the best diaper pants in all brand used every brand but pampers giving more space absorb and its too much soft.
Thank you pampers..
I m a doctor and never recommend it because of it's poor quality.
Thanks to Amazon who make me happy by solving the quality issue. I can believe on Amazon but never on Paper diaper
I have used diaper pants by Pampers for all three of my children and I believe this is the best available brand. My second preference would be Huggies.
Pamper is Good One Great Its Quality is nice Even Doctor Also Recommended For this Diaper.Its Fragnace and absorb water Is Great Good Purchase !!!
I like the product but can't use it more than 3 hours..  All the urine gets absorbed in the front part only n back is dry...
So we has to change the diaper frequently..
Best diaper for ur child....different variety of diaper u gt in market bt use this only....this is the right choice for ur baby...no leakage n work for 12 hrs....ty
"It's good, my child sleeps peacefully, less or no rashes at all... Quality is good, have tried other brands but stopped on Pampers...it's easy to use plus cost effective... Would definitely recommend pampers"
This is good product for baby.. absorption power is too good and overall this is reasonable price product.
Best diaper for babies......no leakage.....no rashes....their r many brand bt this is the best. It works more than 12 hrs....so dont think n try for ur baby....
"These pants are not as good as the diaper style ones. It doesn't last as long either. Maybe because it's cheaper, but it's okay for everyday use if you change it every 2-3 hours. I find it much easier to put on."
"I've been using pampers since birth for my son. Had tried other diapers too. But, he is very happy and comfortable with pampers. The quality, durability and it's ease to use nature makes it better than any other diaper. It's a part of my monthly subscription and I'm extremely satisfied with the product. Thank you Amazon and pampers."
I never had this issue with Pampers  but this time I had a lot of issue with leaks.. despite taking almost care while putting it on my kid.
"The quality of the product is very cheap, The absorbant material is very cheap. I think the road side material is better then pampers. I will complain it 3-4 times in Amazon customer care service, but still are selling the fake product."
Worst ever. It leaks. What is the use of a diaper if it leaks.????? Please stop this product and manufacture a better one please. Switched to mamy poko pants
As i am ordering this product second time with trust...but size is not expected as the same..i ordered same size as previous but it has come smaller size ..i think during packing they misplaced it..and this item is not elligibpe for return ..simply i lost the money
"This material quality have let my son have a good night sleep keeping him dry from 10pm to 7:30am. Well done Pampers. A happy mum here, these nappies are very comfortable and flexible for my little wriggler. Highly recommended."
"I don't even want to give it 1 star!!! My lo got rashes right after d first use, buy pampers extra absorbant for excellent result am returning d product today!!"
"Pampers air channels are so pathetic,,, don't buy it"
Plz don't buy this product it's duplicate diapers ....
Mere bacche k skin pe red colour k chote chote dane aa gaye isse use karne se ...
And palmper k diaper mote hote hai lekin ye patle bhi hai aur 1-2 hr hi chalte hai....
Amzn se itna bada dhoka except nahi kiya tha....
"I won't lie, I tried it on myself..."
"A parent has to check everything if it's good for their children, my piss was absorbed so quick Wow,"
"I've spoken to the admin for getting the same for myself, size 36"
Pampers is the best of all the diapers. I have used others also but the comfort in this my baby feels was not in others. Din leak after usage of 6 hrs.
I always use this brand products for my baby and always fine with that.
But your product seems like duplicate or low quality as product is leaking while using that and I am facing the same issue with each diaper.
Request to Amazon initiate the refund or change the product.

One must buy this without any doubt. We hv heard a lot abt it. So just go for this and make your baby's day happy like other days.
flexible waistband Provide comfortable fit to my baby. It protects delicate skin from rash and irritation. Create space for air to freely inside for breathable dryness overnight.
Item looks good but quality point of view not satisfied. I had purchased same item offline. Compared both items . After fillied diaper with urine it takes more time to leak. Whereas online purchased item not seems that much quality.
I don't know how the quality will be different if both are manufacturered from pampers.
"I thought it's pampers so i ordered 152 unit's pack without any doubt. But it's absorbency is not good, leaks from side and back. And after urine it's not totally dry inside if you touch it's wet your hand. Upset with quality."
Use tape style for new baby. Its really tough to use pant style for new born. We bought this by mistake and realized this very soon
Pampers is the best brand out there in the market.I tried lots of other companies diapers but nothing can beat pampers in comfort and leakage.
Product is 100% fake does not even absorb single per using same pampers since my baby birth but these pampers are worst in quality no gel technology neither holding capacity my baby was screaming like hell in the night once he peed into it.....horrible fake product need my refund back...this is the second time happening in row
"It's the best products amongst all the different brand diapers i have used for my baby.Pampers is best in terms of quality,leak proof and very soft on body.The other best quality is its so light to even carry along while you out otherwise other brand diapers are too bulky."
One star less because twice or thrice the diaper got leaked at night.... otherwise it is gud and I have not faced the issue of rashes after using this even in this scorching heat of summer 😊
Nice quality and very good absorption power... Even after hours the diaper is dry and soft... It doesnt even cause redness or iching.. Best brand
"I always bought diapers from this vendor only from apprx last 2 years for my baby, and I really didn't had any complaint about this. But this time seems I got a duplicate product cz diapers didn't last for 2-3 hours n get leaked even it was not fulled. I am what was the use of diapers if I was changing her clothes 2-3 times in a night.."
"diapers pants are good but very costly, better purchase Snuggles pant diaper, which is same quality  as Huggies but cheaper & in budget."
so thumbs up for  Snuggles.
"now i have stooped using pamper & huggies  & momo poko after trying snuggles, as these costly brands are looting us more."
I peviously use mommy poko pants. qualitywise no doubt pampers is better. my baby is 15 kg but pampers is tight fit to her than mommy poko. She is not fat. Although they claim xl size is upto 17 kg.
Good one for beating other brand. I had rated for 3 star for absorbency and 4 star for Leak proof. For better results you have used premium it's better than normal one and more comfort for infant babys.
Duplicate product
Don't know is there is any way to return as same is opened.
Waste product don't buy it.
Absorption is very less due to which leakage is high. Thereby all the cloth becomes filthy.
"I ordered product which has lotion with aloe vera gel in it for baby's safety however delivery received diaper having normal magic gel. Even after requesting for replacement, I received product having magic gel again and not aloe vera. It seems product with aloe vera lotion was just for showcase purpose & making money by fulling customers"
I always purchase pemers xl through Amazon and no complaints in past time but this time Amazon delivered very low quality.leakage problem again and again
"Expired pampers send me which effect on my baby skin,  whole night my baby cried when checked her diapers nearly I was cry than I checked packet it was expired.  Very much disappointed,  diapers are very thin,  poor quality please don't cheat with product.  Please don't play with kids skin for more earning. Big company with cheap n cheat to the peoples.  Stupid 😥😢."
Pampers has been best diapers for my baby... Light  and absorbent. Material quality is superb.. Long lasting dont neec to change in mid night as well.
"The quality varies from one batch to another. Amazon or pampers should see why this is happening, bought a monthly mega pack by seeing the quality of earlier small order, now the whole bundle is waste."
"I've regularly been buying this product from Cloudtail.  They have been delivering the product on time, I never had to choose Amazon Prime for delivery, thanks!"
Per our experience and having tried multiple branded products Pampers is one of the best diaper product.  It's easy to use and dispose.
These pants are just amazing... its quality is top class and also it provides a different comfort level to my child... i think he just loves wearing it all the time
I always order this pack.But this time the packet delivered seems like a duplicate or faulty..more than 20 diapers are wasted with zero absorption.Try to deliver original products
"The quality is not up to the mark. I have been using Pampers for the past 6 years for my both kids, but never had any issue. Ever since, they have launched Premier brand, these pants quality and durability became worse. Pants get filled up very quickly and leaks very often which has never been the case earlier. Totally disappointed!!"
I perches pamper xl size diaper from nearest med store & the size vary which i purchased from amazon.length and breadth both r 1inch bigger which i perched from medicine store.in pic left one greenline diaper is original and violet line diaper is which i bye from amazon
Quality has reduced considerably.. prices are being increased and number of diapers per pack are being reduced... New ones don't have the same soaking strength that the old packs had..
Quality are good and durability very good ..Maine jaisa socha to usse jyda acha hai aur only 634 rs main mujhe Mila Im so happy and I again buy this thankiu Amazon best discount
"This is very good in quality. When my baby wear this pampers diper he feel very comfort and sleep well. Before that time i not using this my baby feel discomfort all night and  have collins. So when we are using this my baby, me and my husband feels happy. Thanks to pampers diper. Nothing to dislike this."
I bought this pampers for my 9 months old baby girl. And seriously am truly satisfied with this product. The absorption quality of this pampers is awesome. My baby had rashes when I put another brand pant. This is the first time I ordered this and happy with this product quality and my baby is not facing any rashes issue on her bum.
"It s a worst product,their is no adequate pad inside and leaks with in hour......cheatinggggg😡😠😡😠😡😠😡,pls don't buy dis"
This review if for my second subscription delivery and not for overall Pampers product. The packet I received for my last subscription delivery seems duplicate. It leaks almost every night. This never happened before. I notice the diaper feels and looks different from all my previous buys. Not sure if Pampers changed anything or it's a duplicate product. I cancelled my subscription.
Quality :
I would not recommend anyone to buy this as the pampers seem to be of bad quality.Its getting full within 2-3 hours and starts leaking where as a good quality one would stay 8-10hours.
"Whether it's manufacturing defect or bad quality , Better not to buy such big boxes .lesson learned."
"Pampers is exactly the right product for my daughter ..I have recently started using pampers after using other brands ..I settled with pampers..it has great quality as my baby never got diaper rash ,it's depth and lining is perfect so there is no spill and stained diaper ..it's easy for me"
Wear  Tear and Dispose
Pampers new diaper pants(86) extra absorb review
My baby now is 3month old he use this product when he was new born ..but someone's pants leak..material quality is supar & durability up to 8 hours and really it's easy to use...my baby feel comfortable with pampers pants & good price..value for money..
I just gave birth to a baby and these pamper diapers are so comfortable and soft for my baby. They are super absorbent which gives him a sound sleep.
"I purchased this diaper for my kid. Also, I am quite happy with this item. Absorption nature of diaper is truely great."
I let my child wear spoils each night so he can rest an entire night without getting up.
I have used Pampers  since my baby is one month old and order the diapers from Amazon  ... the delivery is fast and always packed well besides I get best deals here so Amazon is always my first choice to order diapers for my baby..and pampers dry pants are best because I have no complaints about it.....no need to check everytime..
Nice product.. Bt its elastic is fit for the babies... It leaves elastic marks on baby's skin... The elastic must be little loose in terms of babies
"I liked the product.....absorbtion is too good, 12 hours+"
 smells good and my twin babies  feel comfortable entire day n night
No rashes
"It's easy to wear and easy to pull off. And my sons skin is a bit sensitive, other brands diaper made her suffer from rashes. But this time no rashes at all. I am impressed ..happy with this product..."
I have got a duplicate product. Extremely disappointed with this product and Amazon. You should not allow this. And the product is not returnable. What to say. Disgusting.
When we are ordering from Amazon
It self we know we get good service
And this is very good product by pamper
I recommend use pamper product its nice and easy to use
No leakages at all
This is product is so poor in size in leak proof and absorbency. It mention in packet 7kg-12kg but when i used in 7.5 kg baby is so tight red marks appers in 2-3 hrs uses. after 2 times toiles the diapers can't hold its dryness and baby feels uncomfortable. bad product Many poko pant medium is too much better then this product.
"It's very convenient for parents to put it on the kid because of it's pant style. So soft and comfortable for the kid. Good absorbance. Perfect hugging fit. Pampers is known for its quality and it lives up to the expectation. A good, soft, comfortable, convenient and value-for-money product."
Compare to M size L size have lesser absorption...larger the size it must have more absorption capability.im changing pampers offer it become saggy quickly
I think Online we got B grade product coz  pampers bought  from local shop before online order were good quality and great absorbinv capacity. But there is absence of absorbness and not useful beyond 2 hours
I don’t understand why the product is becoming less quality item.... it doesn’t work for even an hour... fully it’s leaking out... Nd my baby got rashes bcz of it worst quality.... very poor... pls do manufacture with care since these are baby products and it will affect the infants and babies who are using it...
"Very poor quality , I am buying this Pampers brand regulary from last 2 yrs  but last 2 lots are very poor in quality. Getting teared in side stitches and also getting leaks very soon. They need to improve the quality"
Product is good. And Amazon delivery bhi awesome hai 1 day mein hi delivered kr diya nduku packing bhi bht Sahi ho product ki Softness bhi bht achi ho.
"After wearing of half an hour, Pant feels to much wet and due to wet child feel not comfortable. There is no water observed capacity. After 1 hours of wearing. It was useless. You need to change another pant. Because water observed capacity is not good."
"These pants aren't leak proof. Try Pampers tape diapers, they are the best for newborns. If you want to use pants only, Huggies is the best."
I have been associated with pampers since the day my daughter was born . Initially pampers active and then switched to pampers baby dry pants . They are super soft. Flexible waistband and their lotion with Aloe Vera property has always given a rashfree experience to us.
Extremely satisfied with the quality.
I use the diapers for my son who  is 1 year old when we travel and during night. I need 2 diapers in night and need to change it in the middle of the night if not it seeps out.
recommend to increase the absorption capacity of the diapers.
Product changed leads to product purpose is damaged.. pampers have been great unless the latest upgrade to their designs.. it's filled Just like that and material used is so light that it gets torn while the kid is wearing itself..
"I liked the products & size. Also I got it at a better price from Amazon. Absorbency, leak proof , softness. I would like to recommend to all those mothers who have baby.."
The product is good. It soaks well. Perfect for the baby. The material is soft and it is high absorbent. Great quality. Satisfying.
Very good product... A little bit thinner than what we bought from local shops  but. In this prise it is very much ok ... 12 hrs absorbed.........  I really loved it i got it in 635 rs and it's local market price is 1049 thanku amzon
Good product for babies but can be made more absorbent and the elastic to hold the pant can have an inner fine lining to help reduce the pressure and marks on babies belly.
"Bad Quality , leaks with in 3 to 4 hours. My child pants become wet at night after wearing them. Looks thin and quality not good. Earlier I had bought from Amazon they were good but not this time. I hope Amazon looks into it how the product quantity differs when bought at different times ,the same product. Wasted money this time. I have shared Bad quality cover and Good quality cover images."
The pants are perfect fit for the baby and provides good absorbency and leak proofing as well. Provides perfect comfort for the baby and great product overall.
I cannot find weather it is a duplicate or what but totally I have wasted my money please I refer that not to buy pampers  from Amazon because we believe in Amazon and Amazon is delivered third class item  pampers are thin and it's not have absorption capacity it's leaking
"This brand have let my son have a good night sleep keeping him dry from 10pm to 7:30am. Well done Pampers. A happy mum here, these nappies are also very comfortable and flexible for my little wriggler. Highly recommended...."
But  .........
In market and big bazar same available at cheaper rate. Pampers 68 no. For Rs 600 and this times also at cheaper rate of 590/
Purchased and used otherwise I will return.
My daughter is 2 years old and I have been using only pampers diapers ! It’s super comfortable and I always order monthly subscription boxes as i don’t have to worry buying them for an entire month :)
I think everyone parents should buy this product for their baby..  ..very nice comfortable and soft..
I think this is the best ever diaper i ever Odred.. Leak proof and super softness
It is a very very great product i have ever seen. 12+ hr no tention because its magic gel technology.
Its fit very comfortable.
Its design is also best then other diaper.
And one of the best thing aloe vera helps protect your baby’s skin.
And protect from rashes..
Loveing it....
"Beware of the dispatch guys those who bring the parcel to your doorstep,please open the parcel and read the amount on the bill. My mom took the parcel and did not notice the amount , instead of paying Rs 703, the guy asked for Rs1203 and he got paid."
I checked when i came back home .
Request to everyone pls check your bill in the parcel
Very much comfortable and nice fitting. Cover whole night very easily. Much better than huggies diapers. But Price should lower as it is a baby essentials product and every parents like me can't afford it every time. Thanks
Fake product I must say.
Check offline quality and compare. This diaper leaks easily in 2-3 baby urine.
Can’t work for more than 4 hrs
There is odor coming (like medicine kept inside the pant) and hence not understood whether these pants are suitable for my baby or it can cause issue to my baby. Used one pants from this packet but after few minutes odor spread in home and hence immediately wore out that pant from baby.
Kindly check about this issue.
I like it. My baby feel very happy after wear it. It's keep my baby skin Soft n dry.thnx pamper for take care of my baby. It's a awesome diaper. Must buy.
"I was using mamypoco pants for my niece, but this time used pamper instead and I am too much pleased about my decision. This work like a charm, me along with my sister is satisfied with the quality and absorbing capacity of the product."
"This new updated version of diapers is very thin, dies not absorb well and causes leakage from sides. Older diapers were much better. Not sure why this was changed it upgraded."
Nice quality size is perfect very soft and there is no leakage observed absorption is good enough received as described good one worth it👍
"Being a new parent, we were confused with which brand to choose from. Hospital gave us a gift pack which included Pampers New born pants. It turned out to be good and harmless for our baby and leak proof too. So, we continued with Pampers since then. Now, our baby is 6 months and decided to continue with the same product."
I'm using pampers diaper since my baby born. In last one  year I have tried every size from small to large..this time I ordered large size pampers diapers pant  from Amazon. Pampers pant style diaper very easy to wear.  Pampers is  more comfortable than other diaper.. perfect for my child . Must buy Product.
"Pampers has improved the design of diapers for the comfort of babies, one thing I like most is it has air channels, so that air freely flow inside the diapers and it doesn't cause rashes also because of flexible waistband, I recommend this product"
Everyday morning when my baby wakes up I could see the diaper being heavy and wet inside and it hangs. It would have been good if the product can hold little more water content without getting wet.
We are using pampers for last 2.5 yrs. Product quality is very good . Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate.
"The product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation. I like this very much.😄😄
"very nice. I have been using many diapers of other brands, but this is amazing. it doesn't have leakage problem.my baby sleeps comfortably wearing this at night."
Product is worth the price
No comaprison with the quality
Its easy to use as the instruction are clearly mentioned in the package
"I ordered this pamper for my sister's baby. She praised the product quality. According to her, it is better than Huggies. The absorbing capacity is much higher than another brand. My sister's baby sleeps all night without any cry. That's why I am giving 5 stars because am truly satisfied with this product."
Value for money product..
Many people says it is not good but I have got a new awesome product (good for baby) with well packaged product..
Getting fill too fast even need to change every 2 hrs.. Quality of material inside of diaper looks fluffy n make wet skin ...
I am previously using Mamy Poko but this time i have ordered Pampers for my 9 Month Baby Girl.
I found product quality is super se bhi upar for the same price. better then other brands for sure.
"Seriously this product is total crap. How can you sell such products. My baby had rashes all over after using it for a few days.. Waste of money is not the first concern, but baby's health is for sure."
"I have been ordering Pampers from Amazon for quite some time now. However, this time the quality was very poor. 1 out of 3 diapers are leaking and it's very annoying to carry more no. of diapers to be on the safer side during any outing. If this quality of delivery continues, it would be time to look for other options."
"Pampers diapers are the best Absorbing, leak proof & soft dry pants. By using this my baby sleep well & best part is it's quality & price it's much affordable for all but only thing which is not like me that it's only 1 piece in the package. Thanks to the Amazon for fastest delivery"
Some pieces are damaged but it's original not DUPLICATE.
Some customers told here it's DUPLICATE then I suggest you that please choose a right size for your baby..
This online pamper quality is very worst it's seems duplicate material so need to improve quality & Amazon also need to inspect this type of product & agencies  first.  at last Amazon ruin there own status because of this type of product.
It is a great product material is soft no rashes and no tension to.... Magic gel the locks wetness for up to 12 hours dryness and the desgin is also superb so thanku to Amazon to provide superb product
So soft Tender and leakproof .. free of irritation and Aloevera Coating is superb even fragnance makes baby smile always...
My baby is now 5 months. I am writing my review now. These pant diapers are the best. I use only these exclusively. They are sturdy and absorbant.
Pempers is the best in its category. Using it for my baby last 9 month and no issue with it. Very soft. And leak proof.
"Not at all a product fit for 1 star , I use pamper pants regularly for my baby , these time I order this L size but it looks like S size n the material is too thick I don't think it will absorb the baby 's one time urine also .worst product I am regret on my this order. Not recommend to others ."
I just hate this product . I thought of giving  it a try after using pampers premium diapers as the count wasn’t sufficient for my baby . I have used it earlier too but the material used to be soft . Even the size doesn’t seem to be Xl
Too small as per the size mostly leak happens not sure where pee comes out from diapher. The quality is not that good we were using many pogo pants was better than this and more comfortable. It cost me 576 of 76 diapher so I thought to try but will not buy it again.
I'm using pampers from last 3 yrs now. And I can actually see the improvement. This new dry pants are really nice and comfortable. I haven't find any leakage or rash issues. The son feels comfortable and so do I. Thank you pampers for such good product
"Worst experience with these diaper, it getting filled within 3-4 hours. If we have to change the diaper two times in whole night, what's the purpose of buying it. We will never buy them again."
It is an excellent product for my baby..pampers dry diapers have superb material quality and its durability is good. It protects my baby's skin from rashes and irritation. It has magic gel which absorbs all the wetness and keeps my baby's skin soft and dry. I always prefer pampers as it is very easy to use.
"Pampers is always good...only con I observed is it is not so soft on baby skin,many times I see small lines or wrinkles after continuous usage....if we use it continuously for a day(change at intervals) we can observe this...it can be improved in future."
"This diaper is like a tissue paper and even damages also ,my son as did a twice a toilet in it but toilet starts coming out of it,he is 1 1/2 year old. This type of Diapers are providing in the Amazon ,then you people will say ""Our product is very good""."
its just too small even for a 10 kg baby... makes the baby get rash after first use... never gonna buy it again..
just wasted my money
Product quality is very poor ...it cannot be used more than single hour ..had to change even a single pee...they are making offer by compremising their product quality for making profit..dont waste your money and valuable time
Previously we were using Mamy poko pants they were not up to the mark while absorbing but pampers are very good and soft baby feels more comfortable in this pampers so I have shifted fully
"Dont go for the large packs with extra counts because there's  a slight difference in diapers of same size, which is not gud at all."
Pampers really pampers ur baby..its more than brand name.I have been.usin for 2 years and recommendin for others baby too.The leakage formula is great and the comfort is excellent.Trying other brands I can defintly feel the diffrence
Susu bahar nikal atat h not leak proof and also not fit to new born baby. Don't buy the product.
"Gifted it to my sister's baby,as it is leak proof and very comfortable to use and throw.Fits nicely without any irritation to the baby."
Availed best offer! As a product its far better than himalaya and other products claims to be anti rash but certanly they are not.  It is inline with huggies as well as mami poko pants.
Tried a lot of brands and still gravitate back to pampers. Forever reliable. Never leaked. No odour. Amazing quality. Great deals on Amazon
This is the best daiper brand I have come across. It ensures that the baby stays dry all night long. It had great absorbency. I and my baby get peaceful sleep thanks to its leak poof fitting.  It's surface ensures softness on baby skin to avoid skin rash
Received very low quality diapers.most of them leaked.the worst shock was to find 2 out of the last few diapers heavy n had stains of baby's motion.. as if they were just recycled or something  n carelessly packed. They didn't smell bad but we're heavy .calling customer care was useless.will be filing a complaint
Excellent product ..In reasonable price.. awsome qualities .. easy to use. Good Packing...!good product nice quality fantastic quality product i am using this product for a very long time
Pants material is not good.. My 6 KG weighted baby is having red marks because of tightness.. L size is for 6 kg n above weighted baby..so it should not be that right.. I could not replace it also...
"We had received very bad quality of pamper diaper since last 2 times .this time the quality is even lower than previous one,they leaked wid in 2-3 hours and there are less thicker and lighter than Pampers which we purchased from market.you people are running a big sale company then why you are cheating people .."
Worse product that I ever purchase. Company writes many good things about there product but all are wrong. First time I purchased this particular diapers for my one year old baby and she get UTI due to these diapers. Even changing diapers very frequently.
Don’t buy this particular product not safe for kids.
It's so soft. But absorbency is too bad. Also doesn't fit as per the size mentioned.
Go for mamy poko pants.
"Awesome product, loved it. Diaper fits perfectly. My baby seems happy with it. It has mild fragrance, good absorbency.."
This is a do must buy if you have a baby and There are really useful. You can get it online easily with a good discount rather than going to a shop.
"Diapers are too small, suitable for new borm baby. My baby is 4kg but these diapers are not comfortable for my baby. Elastic marks are coming due to diaper, leakage is also there. Previously, i was using taped diapers, that was too good. Otherwise, pampers diapers are good."
I don't think it's the same Pampers we buy from shop.. It starts leaking after 2-4 hour's of usage. It's cost effective but you will end up using at least five piece per day.
"I used this product first-time. It is very good diaper. Super duper quality, no rashesh, no redness, human skin friendly, leak proof, ultra soft. I willl give 10 out of 10 to this diaper."
Its easy used and Good product
My wife was too angry because of bad dipar pants using for my baby... Then I ordered it from this seller & Amazon and it is very nice.
Now my baby after wearing it playing well.
Quality is perfect also size.
Thanks seller for this kind of things.
"The quality of the product has been unsatisfactory. It leaks, doesn't sustain a night even. I know you would say it depends on the amount an infant urinate however my question is ...don't you know about it? Seems to me it is a business tactics to force customers to buy a more premium quality product from them."
Even though it's written the pants is for 4- 8 kg baby but it's too tight for my baby . Speciapy the waist side and due to the tightness that area has become red and he is just 4.7 kg. So better buy a sample product and check whethe your baby is feeling comfortable.
Super product. It feets the baby perfectly and easily. It does not have any harm in using and it makes baby fill comfortable. And also it is leak proof. And after using it baby has the healthy sleep at night...
Product quality is very good . Fittings is great and it is also very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate.love it
I've always used Pampers baby dry for my son since the day he's born. We are very happy with the ability to soak and I'm glad I don't have to worry about dripping diapers. Even through the night he's is fine and doesn't have to be changed in the middle of the night even though he pees frequently.
Have been using pampera since day 1 when my daughter was born.
"Initially used newborn pampers,  nd dan shifted to pampers pants,  it is leak proof,  has a super absorbency level , also the softness suits my baby curing her from rashes."
Thank you pampers for being so gentle with the skin.
Please please don’t buy this product. Worst quality like a paper napkin.waste of money. I’m just throwing away.
This used to be good. Now it's half as size of the old one with same price. Feeling cheated. Earlier one lasts for almost 6 to 8 hrs. This one just lasts 2 to 3 hrs. Don't ever buy this in any quantity. To for some other brand after checking their smaller packs first.
Pampers has been my choice for my child since he turned 6 months. Buying this pack is just right for his monthly diaper requirement as he wears them at night. The fit is good and I haven't faced any leakage issues till now
"Best pampers in India, hands down! I’ve tried about every diaper here for my children and these are truly the best!"
"product absorbency is too good , 1 or 2 ped is not for locking leackage for long time , softness is best for baby"
What I love :
1. deodourises effectively
2. Soft on skin
3. Fills evenly
4. Fits snugly
What I wish for :
1. Better absorption (unexpected leaks are common )
2. Fullness indicator
"Pampers are the best diapers with a gud material quality perfect for the delicate skin of babies, and the best side is that its designed such a way that its super  easy to use."
Package is gud and fast delivery.
My baby looks comfortable and happy of using it.It soaks toilet for 7-10 times easily.Thanks to its advanced absorption technique.
As described the product and shipment is also fast....only thing is that price is not constant...keeps changing every time....
But no issue with product
"I am not sure whether pampers are in fault or the company which is marketing through Amazon..Diapers seems to be duplicate it's leaking through the waist area, getting totally filled within 5 hours...No idea wats wrong...Anyways going further not going to order diapers from Amazon.."
I thought that the quality of the product will be good considering its Pampers. Please don't buy this. Rather pick the other velcro version of active baby.
This was fake. The diaper did not last even for 3 hours and became heavy and soiled. My child got a rash as well. This never happens with store brought pampers.  The diaper did not have proper logo of the company either. Amazon parceled fake product. Highly disappointed. Please do not buy this.
This daupers are very soft and gentle for the babies. Didn't see any leaks what so ever.
Liked it and recommended to everyone.
Got it for my nephew. Easy to use diaper. Quality is good. Glue is easy to use. No leaks till now. Using it daily
Each one of it leaks. Good for newborns or infants less than an year old but worst for toddlers. I have used the product outside India as well and there pampers’ products are way better than the one they produce for/in India. They need to brush their minds really clean.
"i am using this product from the first day of my girl's birth and this product never disappoints me and quality and full leakage proof, very thin unlike other diapers."
i will highly recommend this to every mommy
superb product and this will not disappoint you.
"Best baby pants compare to other companies brand. Baby get relaxed.  No itching, no rashes, no any fungal infections."
Great quality pants for baby. I used Pampers pants day zero for my baby. I will definitely recommend it to others.
I have used both pampers L64 pack and mamy poko pants L64.
Price wise both are same. But pampers pants are smaller and thinner as compared to mamy poko pants of same size ie Large.
Soaking ability of pampers is not effective and water leaks after 3 to 4 hrs.
So better to use mamy poko pants which are the best.
"Best product This brand have let my son have a good night sleep keeping him dry from 10pm to 7:30am. Well done Pampers. A happy mum here, these nappies are also very comfortable and flexible for my little wriggler. Highly recommended."
Leak proof and softness
"Pampers Baby Dry Diaper Pants give softness, breathable dryness, and comfort....Magic gel that locks wetness away for upto 12 hours."
"Great product, brand like pampers is always worth trusting. Its cotton very soft and no worry of rashes. Magic gel works magically locks water almost 10 hr and also Easy to change, just tear it from sides."
my expectations are met with this product.
"What a scam product. You guys don't even spare kid products. Even this is duplicate.. Tears off while putting in, leaks as well. Guys beware.. Spend wisely.. These heavy discount products are super duplicate"
"Quality of the this product is not good. Leak proof doesn't work, product not up to the standard sold in the market. For the second time it happens like this. Second quality of product sold on the site?"
Feedback sent to pampers also.
Clearly decided not the buy the product in Amazon.
"In night tym it doesn’t soak a lot as it’s written ,,,it vl work for 6-12hrs but for my baby i used it for 4 hours only"
"Quality bakwaas hai my baby weight is 4.5 kg and medium size diaper m hi marks aa the h usko, other hand mamy poko pant is very nice product and baby bhi comfortable hai"
They are super absorbent. At least for six to eight hours they don't leak.
Easy to get it wear to kid.
So soft and hygienic.
When It comes to ur baby’s skin care mama always choses the best and pampers never disappoints me!! Its perfect for my baby
"I am regularly using Pampers for my kids since more than 3 years,happy with product ,no leakge ,no rashes on skin ,baby feel comfortable & and price is also less when compared to competetiors of other brand ,I will recommend parents to go for it."
I have used 2-3 brands of diapers before but after using Pampers haven't used anything else. Best for all night long plus all day for my super active kid. The brand should give some discounts for bulk buys ...
The size for Medium diaper is almost the same as small diaper. Its M for name sake only. Recently four diapers were leaky. Then I feel it's not worth to buy this. Earlier some 82 pieces used to come. Now they have reduced the size of diaper and also the quantity. Am not going to buy this diaper next time.
I m pampers mom since my baby born I have use different sizes and types of diapers it is best among all you can trust this brand highly recommended
Pampers is one of best brand among diapers..Quality is good..Easy to use..No leaks upto 12 hours of use..Grab it during Amazon sales only under lightning deals only
Very disappointed with this new so called Air.. Diaper fills very quickly and has a wet feeling to the kid.. Also itching.. Very bad. And sailing in low price whereas the previous extra absorb price is increased.. Bey bad step from pampers or Amazon not sure..
Pampers baby-dry pants diapers with new air channels and lotion with aloe vera providing my baby dryness overnight  ..Material is very soft and no rashes.  We have not got any issues with leaking till now because of gel Lock system. Flexible waist band that can fit easily to any baby weight.
It is a fake product. It will not last more than 3 hours. Waste of money. Even inside foam will come out during the night. Dont take risk with the health of your child. Amazon will not support you for refund and return of this product.
I liked the product when I purchased offline but the quality of the product ordered through Amazon is inferior and obviously Amazon sold a FAKE product.
"In fact, I had couple of diapers left from the offline purchase & when I used them today morning, the quality was much better!!"
Hi
I'm very disappointed with the Quality of pampers received ths this time. The thing is after some time of  changing the liquid comes out of the pamper making the cloths wet. This is d first time i have noticed d problem. Hav used other products as well bt  can't belive pampers quality going low.
"It's an easy to use and comfortable product for my baby. it's my only choice of diapers. I have used it for longer durations as well, when I had no choice. So it absorbency is good"
we used this pack before 2 days back.  This time we received package is not good quality.  or not original product we received.. our kid fall for infection.  as per doctor told diaper is not good quality.  we used 5 or 7 peaces from packet.  requesting you kindly refund amount the same
Thanking you
Its not original product..thr is a huge difference between this one and the market one..baby pee always leak whn baby is sleeping..
last time i ordered same pamper pants but 60 packs varient and the product was very good .. but now this 86 pack variant is not of good quality.. pants r vry thin and may leak
"This is my first time order of pampers in online,very nice product, price also less compare to market price. Quality also good. Most trusted brand for children"
I always heard that pants are difficult to use when baby poop. Trust me..pampers dry pants are superb durable n easy to use n remove.
The disclaimer itself goes wrong. You have to walk up wet if you use one diaper for 1 night. You have to change in the middle of the night if you purchase this. Pathetic experience from last 3 packs. Not sure if pampers is dumping waste products on us or if its fake
I am subscribing the Pamper pants medium for about 8 months now. The quality of the diaper of last two subscription are too poor. Diaper are thinner than normal and leaks most of the time. I am planning to stop the subscription if I continue to receive same quality.
This is a top brand for babies and it’s best to go for baby’s comfort. Super soft and cottony. It’s really easy to use and quite affordable.
Magic gel really works. It absorbs plenary of fluid and change to gel. Also aloe vera gives softness to baby's skin.
I have tried almost every brand..but this one is best for my son...no more diaper marks and one diaper for entire night....recommend for every parents...
"As a mother, i can totally rely on these diapers  for mg baby carefree night sleep . Really good absorbing capacigy and soft for baby skin"
"I have purchased this for Rs 693 in July ‘19. The product is an original one, and the price was my buying point for purchasing it here in Amazon. This is usually available for Rs 730 in any medical/big retail shops."
I always use  and suggest this for babies..
because its safe .. never causes rashes..
but it needs to be best .. because its leaking from  sides which sometimes causes major issues while travelling.. ..
you can buy Active babies pants  it your baby is too active
I am using these diapers from the day my baby was born.. These are the best diapers .. They do not give any rash and are totally leak proof.. one diaper is enough for the whole night.. I am regular user of these diapers for my baby.. love them
Product quality is very good . Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate.
Best diaper for kids as I am using this Brand from last 1.5 years and also tried other brands but pamper is best as absorb very well and its very soft best go for it
"This seems like duplicate or defective product. The quality of the item is pathetic compared to the store bought Pampers package. It doesn't absorb as much, leaks and also tears up very easily."
Amazon needs to prevent such products on their portal.
"I’ve been ordering Pampers since my baby was one month old, he’s 11 months old now and i’m very satisfied with the quality of diapers by Pampers. Just don’t understand why do they decrease the number of diapers as the size increases. Other then that no issues yet."
I have been using pampers ever since my son's birth....but this is the worst quality ever this is fake...doesnt hold for more than 3 hours...and my son got a rash too..totally dissappointed
Very good product . It’s totally leak proof. It’s really soft which helps in avoiding diaper rash. I am very happy with its absorbency because I do not need to change the diaper in the middle of the night. It gives protection for 8-9 hours at a stretch . I would recommend this product to all the moms
Very nice quality diapers
Comfortable for child.
Good absorbing quality
Easily wearable
Fitting is also good.
Value for money
The best thing is that your child does not get rashes after wearing even for the long time.
That's why i always prefer pampers for my child.
Best diaper pants I have used. Very soft and nice scent. I use it overnight and no leakage. Price could be lower.
Keeps getting full in 3 hours and then leaks. The new upgrades the company has done has made the product worse
Been using for last 5 years for both my kids. They sleep peacefully thru the night. No leakage and very soft on baby's skin
This is total use less and bad product...These diapers even don't work for 3 to 4 hours....I will not recommend to anyone...Even sometime it gives feeling that this is not original product of pampers brand..Plz check it..
Superb pampers is always pampers
 no irritation or no leakage or no skin rashes compared to any other product I found
Looks like the product is duplicate .
"I am a regular purchaser of pamper from amazon , I saw there was more offer on this product and didn’t see the Delear ."
But the product looks like duplicate not like the original quality .
Diaper is not at all good it's got leaked very soon.I ve selected 9 to 14 kg I.e L or Size 4 but it's very tight for my daughter.Normally 9 to 14 kg size diaper suits properly but this time it's worst and tight.Please note my daughter is very lean and just 10 kg but still it's Very worst and tight.
"The product quality is very good compared to any other brands... My son sleeps through the entire night and we do not need to change his diaper until the next morning. Very satisfied to use this product of pampers pants it truly absorbs everything and keep him comfortable!"" Thanku Amazon for on time delivery 👍👍👍"
I have been using Pampers for two years and I am very happy with  the product except for this (AIR) as its not durable so I wont recommend it to any body. Pampers India has been doing great in earning the reputation till now but after this product I am sure Pampers customer will run away if they only think of earning money and not taking care of little ones.
Material quality is not good. It is getting filled within 2 or 3 hours. Don't know whether they are selling duplicate products. I had used many other brands. But this is worst product. Mamy poko pants is very nice compared to this. Elastic waist band is not soft. Compared to other brands size is also smaller.
I am a regular customer of amazon but this supply of Pampers of L & XL is very defective. During the use these Pampers leaking badly. My babies dress gets wet and in nights his bed also dump. So what use of this defective product you supplied me. After this I am thinking to breakup with Amezan.
Waste product.. Waste of money.. I have wasted my 450 rps just for these paper sheets.. These are not like pampers but it is just a paper... Lot of difference between the real and fake ones.. Please don't buy at all.... Don't get attracted towards the offer.. U will waste your money..
"Material quality is very poor, it is getting filled in 30 min, need to change it very fequently during nights else kids will not have good sleep. Not worthy product."
This is one of the best i have used so far. The main part is it absorbs and keep the baby dry throughout the night and my baby didn’t face any kind of rash on his skin. Mostly recommended 👍🏻
"Somehow we managed to run out of diapers for our kid, used amazon prime now to get these delivered in 2 hours. Good product and decent price."
I only trust Pampers diapers for my child. It's comfortable and extremely absorbent. Keeps my child happy and dry all night . The quality is excellent.
"soft and comfortable, easy to use."
nice material and leakproof
fits perfectly to my daughter of 4 months 5kg
Hi
I like the dyper very much as it has very good n soft material n.good durability.
Well also easy to use surely you should try once
DupliCate item . Don't buy .wastage of money. Completely third class item. I hope that it is better than buy from shop. But it is useless buy from online
I really don't have any complain about the product infact pampers is one of the best diaper brand and give good quality in genuine price. But i have complain about the Amazon that it has very high delivery charge sometimes that the price of the product on Amazon and in market become almost equal.
"Pamper diaper is really the best diaper of all.it has excellent absorbency,no leakage and amazing softness.in fact I can say it's  most amazing and excellent product of all the diapers Inthe world really. I like it and suggest other to use it without any worry"
The product is reliable and the quality is really good. Elastic waist makes it easy to go and the Aloe Vera lotion provides comfort to the baby. It has good absorption formula that keeps the baby dry for a long time. The best thing is that it is rash proof and produces no irritation.
Product is good but price is dissatisfied bcz for some users price is different and for other aome user price is different hopefully price should be unanimous and low and fixed for all customers
Have two kids and both use Pampers dry pants. They are extremely comfortable and easy to use. I don't have to change them in the night as they absorb really well and last all night without any leaks ! Fantastic product!
I prefer pant style diapers for my baby . It is easy to put on and very comfortable. It Does not leak .
Good quality 👍🏼
"One can have pure and higine oil in an hour. I am really surprised with the quality of machine it's really good and work very smoothly. No need any kind of special skill to operate this , and it's cost effective too. Thus it's make sens to spend some money for health."
Worst product . I will never recommend pampers to any parents. My baby had severe rashes and cried a lot due to unbearable pain and suffered a lot. Stop using your business to affect the people. The money which you have earned through this will not be fruitful - painful parent
Durability and quality of pampers is now getting down. My one year boy is using it since his birth. Recently I noticed that it's not lastig even three hours at night. Last few days my baby wake up at midnight and the reason is that the nappy was totally leaked. Now I shifted to Mamypoko from Pampers.
Wasted money......Not original Pampers because every night needs to be changed two or 3 pics Pampers...So don't buy this
As far I have used many brands I feel pampers are best for baby. they don't leak and are soft. I suggest all mommies to go for pampers
"very bad quality,1 piece not use in one night,it become wet quickly."
"Very comfortable, fast absorption, best fitting, skin friendly and most importantly very reasonable price. When it comes for my baby, I can't think of any other options. Only and only pampers.😊"
Quality is very poor as compared to previous type of pampers. We use M size for our twin babies & had no issue with previous quality. This one is so poor....feels like 2-3 thin paperbags put together.
These diapers have long time absorbing capacity. They don't cause any sort of rashes to the baby's skin and are also light weight.
"Worst product, elastic is very tight, goes smaller for mentioned size, can hold only 1 or 2 pee n then it leaks, want to return or replace but its not eligible.. Its pathetic.. Mamipoko pants are best than this."
Pampers are always the best. It's absorbency  is too good and works for continuous 8 long hours. The design and material is also perfect for the baby.My baby enjoys wearing Pampers pants and loves it.
When compared to ordinary pampers this is a great deal of product..the product is lighter than ordinary pampers..my child is very comfortable..my child is in her sixth month and M size is apt for her..
"Even when the diaper is heavy, doesn’t make a big lump.. go for it! No diaper rashes too.. very soft material"
"very light, thin, good elastricity, u can use younger to elder baby easily due to weight. some times leakages occurd, when u get late to change.but i loved it."
"It is very soft cotton materials,  good absorbency,  perfect fit in different sizes,  simple style,  light weight and easy to carry.  I truly recommend to all to try once and compare with others.  It is the best brand of diaper.  Though it is quite expensive."
Pants for newborn is a stupid idea. It won’t stay put  on their waist and it easily slides down as it gets heavier. I recommend getting the ones with stickers untill the baby puts on a little weight to let the pant diapers hold on to their waist.
It says 12hrs but withing 4 to 5 hrs it starts leaking.. Now when i say 4 to 5 hrs my 1yr old  kid would not be peeing for more than two times and he feeling its irritating. He starts pulling it out.. I doubt the product which I received is genuine or not..
"Dear Amazon, please do look into the matter of originality of products. I have been buying Pampers monthly packs for quite a few times now. All these while we got genuine product. But this specif8c order where i am writing now, i got a different set. Thoght its a new thing. Going to see my baby started feeling the difference. The urine used to come out on the bed, just once after use. Elastic was giving marks. Checked online, it was exactly as they had quoted how duplicate to be."
"I am hereby attaching a photo, clearly indicating the difference."
"I tried pampers, huggies n mamy poko n i like mamy poko best for its absorbency n softness.  Pampers pants leaves marks on my baby"
Worst quality product. Look like a paper. Not leak proof. I am using for my 9 month old baby absorb quality is not good and started leaking up after 2 hrs. West of money.  Fake product.
It appears very thin .. as someone said in comments.. like paper. We used mamypoko pants before this and they used to be very good. Moving back to it.
It is a very soft diaper that keeps my baby dry overnight.  No itchiness no rashes occur. It also absorbs the bad oudour.  Gives baby a happy sleep
This is the best diaper for small babies.The properties of anti rash makes it suitable for new borns. It doesn't leak once it's full as the absorbance is superb
Nice product from trusted brand.. leak proof.. very soft.. easy to use.. proper fit.. good designs and shape..
Before I purchased pampers xl 7 quantity pack. I was very good quality. After I ordered pampers xl 112 quantity. But quality is not same. It poor quality and absorb less quantity of liquid. 7 pieces pampers we use one piece per night but 112 pieces pampers we have to use 2 pieces per night.
Pamper company is always best in diapers because of its softness and water absorbency. It is fully leak proof. I love this product
I have purchased this fur my 8 months old baby.
Diaper does not leaks and also did not become heavy as weight is evenly distributed.
Also baby feels comfortable.
I feal being cheated. As I have always purchased same product from Grocery shop never faced the following issue.
1) It leaks
2) It tears while putting it on
3) Gel is coming out of the diapers.
I think this is old products sold with new date.
It’s a good baby product. Provide leak proof nights and easy to use and comfortable for baby to wear.
Most recommend to all new mothers!
Im big fan of pampers.. its absorbant power is excellent.. its leak proof.. im using this brand for 2 years old of my son.. so comfortable.. on journey time i use day and night no rashes found... Pamper pant style diapers are sooo good to use..
Very soft to my kid skin. Easy to wear and tear...
Using Pamper brand since years so I trust Quality.
I recommend
I am really unhappy for this product.My whole money 749 rupees was totally waste.i did blindly trust pampers diaper but the quality of product is very bad as compared to other brand. At last the punishment is  again i have to buy diaper for other brand.This is really frustrating for such type of product sell by Amazon.
I have used Pampers for my baby from day 1 very good results and great absorbency and doesn't get leaked overnight
Pampers have always been best of all. Recommed this after several repeat purchase and trying other brands in diapers amongst all
Best brand Pampers. Its helps the baby.
"I have purchased it from amazon.in so many times, as a customer i would like to say its just awesome!! 👍"
Must buy if u have baby. Its a baby care product.
"Thanks ""Pampers"""
"It was a great product , soft and leak proof"
"Very satisfy with pampers diaper, i got the parcel before time & those diapers are very soft and leak proof so you can go for this."
Third class product ....froud the customer..
"Seems like duplicate product, not absorbing for few hours of use it get busted since uniform absorbing not there, one place getting heavy and bulgy and burst easily, first time facing this issue in 4 years of purchase from cloudtail"
Loved the product. It has the good absorbency capacity so that the child do not suffer for the cold. And also its good the child skin. Would like to purchase it again.
Last one and half years I bought this product by Amazon for my little son. And really always  giving me the best and original product. Thanks for Amazon. But now I hv a big pblm... Cod/pod is not available in my address 😢
Very bad product mere baby ko bahot rash aa rahi hai jabse use kar rahi hu... Ek bar use kartey hi rash aarahi hai .. Very bad product  i want refund kese return karu dont know i hv used 5 6 diapers
Bought these for my nephew . He is more comfortable in pampers pants as compared to others. Absorbent quality is very good and no leakage .
"This "" AIR "" model is worst of any other Pampers product. it is not covering entire portion and leaking"
"We used Pampers with our first child with excellent results. We changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money. She started having yeast infection, rashes, and woke up fussing nightly. And it's worth to buy."
"We have tried many other diapers, but nothing beats the quality and stability of Pampers.. it's a perfect fit and absorbs it all during long hours of night sleep. Would surely recommend it"
I really like this product b/c other brand pants have heavy material used .which cause babies skin rashes. Pamper have light material and good absorbing qwality with no leakeg. Babies skin is soft and rashes free in all season. I strongly recommended to all mother use pamper brand pant...
Old buyer from Amazon of pamper pants.
From last 4 months they changed the quality and size of the diaper. Very disappointed.
1) BEST Absorbency POWER
2) PRODUCT IS VERY SOFT WHICH IS GOOD FOR BABY(USER)
3)GOOD QUALITY(ABSORB WATER)
4)WORTH BY VALUE
Totally west of money it leaked...baby feels so uncomfortable.....don't don't don't don't don't buy at all jus go for snuggls/ supplies it's having cheap ratethen branded dipers and having good absorbing captivity but don't buy ever pampers it's most worst product
"Not as earlier recvd products, quality has detoirated and as i had read many recent reviews..its true that the padding does not last for more than 12 hrs."
"I used many diapers for my baby but first time i use pamper,it is really extra soft than other diapers so i suggesting you pampers."
Thanks for delivery on time.
"Nice pamper pants...really so soft and baby frels very comfortable...no leakage, no rashes...babies upto 5 kg can wear this...original product."
The quality of the product is good and is reliable. It has nice absorption rate and keeps the baby safe from rashes. The addition of aloe vera lotion makes it hygienic and is quite comfortable for the baby. The best part is its elastic waist band which makes it easy both for mom and baby.
These diapers are not a regulars ones. They W either take or reduced quality.
The quality of these  diapers 1/3rd  of regular pack.
"Got cheated by monthly pack.  You need minimum 3 of them per night, where as we need just one if it is regular"
Very cheap quality especially the waist bands are a kind of low quality plastic which creates lots of marks and the durability is poor
Worst quality diper i never seen like that i think this is fake pampers dippers because i am using this brand last 3 year but i never face that kind of issues before but this time diper leakeg heavy diper its not work last long this experience is my really bad  so I never used after that
Very very worst product.... am very dissapointed with this product..... quality of this diaper is very worst.... you are cheating with  babes product also.... what you people are going to get.....now am taking oath at this moment.... here after I wont buy it from any thing on amzone.....
"Quality has come down.. the one that I bought last month was good. I reordered the same this month from cloudtail seller, but got a very low quality one this time. It leaks always, can't use it. Amazon needs to check the quality of it and why differs btw orders"
I have used Pampers for both of my babies. Once tried to switch to another brand but regretted as it was not leakage proof like Pampers. With Pampers you don't have to worry for leakage or any kind of rashes.

why
The product is good. The only drawback that I felt is that it was not soft . On using it my child had rashes . otherwise a nice product with good absorbency
"This is not pampers it is duplicate i have not observed till now i thought some changes were made initially but now i can say it is the worst product i have used some daipers and it is not as ushual colour, absorbance and even size is also worst havr to complain"
There are various diapers flooding in market but I always trusted pampers. Really it is best I think as far as any aspect is concerned. It makes mother tension free. Worth buying.
"Little non-airy, but absorbs really well. Must be changed in 4 hours in order to prevent leakage and rashes"
Product leaking more and absorption is less and to be improved leak proof and absorption property
"O wow I like this diaper ,I used a diper previous night for my baby ,and there is no rashes on his skin.and there is no leakage in the diaper.soft too"
Third class quality this time..
My baby is 8kg and this diaper does not last for 4 hours
The rubber gets broke and after 4 hours everything in the diaper starts to come out..
Very poor experience this time purchase
This product is too comfortable the material is used is very soft for the sensitive skin of our babys. The price is also affordable. Baby sleeps  peacefully overnight and we also happy to use Pampers loved it .
Using pampers for my kid since a long time and it absorbs pee and it's odourless. New pampers are leak proof and in budget
Good experience to purchase pamper online.. From look wise it is original product. But absorbing pad is somewhat thin what i expected
Worst quality of dIaper have ever used till date for my baby.not even work for one hour and mentioned size also wrong.my baby not feeling comfortable after wearing this diaper.they knew that quality of diaper is bad that why they have mentioned no return policy.not recommend to buy this product.
The product we have purchased it’s was completely drastic in terms of quality.diaper got leaked after 30 min of wearing when we purchase the same product from the store it was fine but whenever we purchase the same from amazon it was a duplicate product..and there is no return policy.
if baby is paseing 2tms urine means pamper is looking too heavy.and its soon hanging and baby is feeling uncomfortable.i changed now this pampers
It fits tighter on my 4 months old so it gives him rashes.
I'd rather prefer mamy poko pants.
It leaks. It doesn't last for even half of the time they claim. Just 2-3 hours. Either Pampers quality has spiralled down or this is duplicate product. It's a shame. I don't recommend anyone to buy this product. Minus rating!! Forced to give it 1 star for submission ease.
Nalla product aanu.
Enikk  personally happy aanu. Nalla soft aanu and absorbency und.
Frst  tym order cheyyunavark  onnum pedikkathe dayryamaayitt order cheyyam. Nalla product aanu. Ithu ente  9 mathe order aanu.  Dedicated malayalees.  This is my honest review.
"These are the best diaper pants i hv ever used for my baby. First of all they are so affilordable, 2ndly they fit so well to my baby (size M), these hold baby’s pee for more than 5 hours and lastly these are super soft on babies soft skin...m really happy with my purchase"
Very happy with Pampers
Diapers
It is very comfortable for my baby and use it whole night its dry and less heavy
I would recommend all moms to go for it.
No rashes or marks on my babies skin.
Happy diapering........
Dunno what's happening with Pampers diaper pants...becoming think day by day...dunno whether it's for good or bad...if possible try to make some products that reduces the odour...and a indicator too..
The quality is just amazing as it doesn't leak a single drop of water in the whole night. Perfectly fits for my baby
"I love pampers diapers on my baby's bum. Its higg absorbent hence no worries of changing in night, super soft on his skin."
Okay okay kind of.. but if u r using it over night baby might feel the wetness aftr few hours.. fake produ t i got frm online i believe
"I have been using pampers baby dry right from the start for my little one.. The pant style is most convenient and leakproof with all the jumping around he does. It Keeps my baby dry all night.Satisfied with the material too, as have experienced less diaper rash..A trusted choice, all put together.."
It is not bad but compare to other one it is thinner.
Absorbing capacity is lower.
Products material is good
This wasn't a good to use...other premium and active baby pampers are good to use. sometime the urine is draining out. This will create racious
"These pants are not as effective as Pampers tape diapers. Tape diapers are better only one is required for night. Whereas minimum 2 pamper pants are required for night as it leaks, never buy pants tape diapers are far far better and inexpensive as compared to these bakwas pants"
This is an excellent product and a total saviour for all new mom's. The baby is so very comfortable. I haven't faced any diaper rash issues or any other issues after using these diapers...so it's highly recommended
Guys never buy this product...it's really a uncomfortable for your baby...most worst diaper.
"Free advice to manufacturers, if you want to sustain pls go by product survey & make your product in a quality way to use."
Hi
more than 10% in the lot were defective. and this happens almost everytime. hence the cost/ piece comes to Rs 9.5/piece  instead of 8.07/piece as claimed above.
Final conclusion : its better to buy pack of 20-30 ones.
Pamper is good I was use for my 8 month baby.she is very comfortable in pamper dipper.material is good no leakage problem.easy to wear.
I am using the pampers since my child birth. Great product as compared to huggies and mamy poko. But this time price is not mentioned on the packet. I am unable to calculate the discount as there is no MRP mentioned.
Best absorbency. Never leaked after all night use. Baby never had rashes and he is super comfortable.
"I have been using Pampers pant for six month and also ordered so many time from Amazon and I found the product satisfactory every time but this time I found a very poor quality in recently purchased pant like leakage, damage in few time and result in rashes. This packet is defected"
"From the day my baby is born I’m only using pampers diaper, i love the quality it’s so soft and i have never experienced any leakage from diaper. Do purchase it one of the best diaper in India"
"These are not premium quality diapers by Pampers. Mamipoko diapers are very good in quality & it is premium, for my son we purchase diapers. Every time we purchase mamipoko, but this time we tried Pampers very poor quality, next time I don't go for Pampers."
"I always purchased pamper for my child from amazon almost every time.  But this time the quality of the diaper was worst,  they cant stand for 2 hours. So pls maintain the quality Amazon.  U have always giver super quality products and services.  But this one has disappointed me."
"M size of news pant with air channels is smaller than the earlier pants M size. Have been using it for my kid for last 4 months without any issue. But this time, the pack with channels is sent."
It fits tight to kid compared to previous one.
I can assure that the pamper diaper will comfort the baby. It is really really worth buying.
"This is a very nice product, I am very impressed with this. It's work long 10 to 12 hours without leaks."
Quality is good and it is the best diaper compare with others.
Pamper really keeps the baby pampered throughout...  My daughter is 6months now..  Happy and healthy..  From pampers new born to xl going great..  As compared to other daipers pampers are soft to skin.. Easy to change..
Kind of a must have.
My things is returning to you I don’t know what is the reason actually I give address is ok I’m Always receive before the same address but now problem is Parcel service
Your things all is good
it is a good product and material is also good the diaper pants easy to put on easy to tear while removing quality of the product is very good overall it is a good for childrens.
Holds maximum urine easy to use. Tge material which is used is also best as well as the delivery of the product is also before time. So thanks to Amazon for gud deals and gud services.
"I have been using this since my baby's birth... No issues of rashes nor leakage... My lo feels comfortable in pant style Pampers .. easy to wear and tear... She is happy playing, peaceful sleep..."
"This is the best diaper for kids, Used it for my newly born kid...."
"Its absolutely leak proof, And it doesn't caused any kind of rash on child skin..."
"The softness of skin is after 12 hours also, This is a great product...."
"Material quality is thin, can't even lasts from night 10PM to morning 6AM, it starts leaking as the absorving pad given is so thin, go for other brands rather than Pampers as it will make you uncomfortable as well your beloved child too ."
Very nice product and hygenic when compared to other competitors. Baby didn't have any rashes after using this. Also the product delivered on time as promised. The Pampers product as advertised gives upto 12 hours of leakage protection if baby doesn't fill it up much (tested)....
"Material quality is good but pee come out very early out of diaper compare to product ""pamper extra absorb"" . Durability of product is pathetic. I would suggest to buy pamper extra absorb instead of this."
It's very soft and baby Will feel comfortable without diaper rash. I am using the pampers for my baby since day one. It's awesome. It's easy to use and material quality is super and it's durable for whole night.
My son used to wet a lot and will not sleep properly becoz of it. After using Pampers he's getting good sleep. It'll hold for 10 hours and doesn't give any rashes. Recommend this strongly...
I am ordering for pampers diapers since 1.5 years n this time received a very bad quality product. The Absorbtion capacity is absolutely zero..it feels tat it is duplicate product. Never experienced such a bad product quality through Amazon in past. Kindly give a fresh product asap
Pampers dry pants are best for its quality. Its material is good enough to keep the baby skin rash free. Unlike other diapers this are long lasting and absorb maximum without making the diaper bulky. As its pant style easy to wear. The size fits perfect as per the weight.
I Am using Pampers from very long time and as they commit it is up to the mark I may happy with the quality and on time delivery
"Hi I usually orde pamper XL everymonth, but this time by mistake small size has come, please exchange it to XL. It's a request. Since I can't return it"
"The product delivered this time is very bad. Keeps on leaking, probably quality decreased or got a fake product."
"I am using Pampers diapers and pants from the time my daughter was born. They are the best brand by far.. I have tried other brands also.. but Pampers is the best! It's quality is best, comfortable for baby.. and are reliable. You can get them for great price and value for money."
Product is leak proof and good absorbency. No rashes. Frequently using. Using in night time only. Replace in 6 hours.
1.Awesome product . Material is very good.
2. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
3. Absorbing capacity is very good.
4. Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal pamper diapers.
5. money worth product.
I have been using pampers for my kid from birth for their quality.
But this last lot wasn't Upto the mark.
It starts leaking within two hour's of use.
And only the upper portion of front part gets filled . I think it's a duplicate product being sold on Amazon.
"The material quality is much below standard expected of Pampers. The mammy pogo are much better in terms of quality as well as price. I have stopped ordering these now, writing a review after using two months, just needed to use all that I ordered."
"Have been using pampers since my child's birth.. And absolutely happy woth the product.. No leakage, no rashes"
"Pumpers is the brand which doesn't need any explanation, easy to use, comfortable on baby skin, no rashes problem, it's keep skin dry overnight"
Super quality one of the best pampers pants I request to all mothers please please don’t see price higher or low please see the quality and your kids comforts and health too try this pants moms
"Hi,"
We recieved this product and it is very bad in the performance. Seems like it is duplicate or some seconds stock. All of them started leaking in 1-2 hours of usage. It has never happened earlier though. We have been using Pampers Diapers bought offline and they work perfectly fine. Buy them with lot of care!!! It can be fake !!!!!
"We were purchasing it for more than 3 years now but whenever they come-up with this new ""Air"" its not that good as that of the older model. this leaks every time  and torn out when you tried to wear the baby. the product quality is low"
"Very poor quality. Absorbency,leakproof,softness is very very poor."
Off line quality and online quality is different.
So don't prefer online quality.
They are manufactured different kinds of quality with same price ie online.
"Soft and highly absorbent. No leakage even after long hours. If you are searching for diapers, buy this with your eyes closed."
The most important factor in case of diapers is Durability.
"Before I got this product I was having blind trust in pampers but after this, I am doubtful about the quality."
My observation:  The large is the number of diapers - Smaller price we pay/diaper == Worst quality.
I liked the products & size. Also I got it at a better price from Amazon. I can reccomend to all the mons out there.
It is a vary good product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too.. I am fully satisfy with this..
"This is very great product, I am using this for my baby for past two years there is no rashes until now because of pampers only. Wearing the pampers my baby feels so comfortable while sleeping."
Have tried this brand for this time on my 9 Month Old baby. Its absolutely NOT leak proof.  We had great experience with other brands. Totally waste as it leaks every time.
Nice product... Safe for babies...
100% leak proof...
During night babies ll sleep nicely n peacefully...
Good one
"We are buying pampers since my baby born, this is first time I ordered XL size and found that diapers pants are delivered to us this time is not good."
"Out of last 10 diapers, 4 have leaked even after 2hrs of use. Quality is very poor."
"Very bad quality. It is leaking and not absorbing. Could be duplicate product. We experienced twice. If we buy same size of pampers from supermarket like ""Spar"", the quality is evident to say ""buying from Amazon at offered price"" will not meet the quality which we expected."
Best choice for child. very soft material. Easily useable. Much better than any other brand. I am gonna use it for long.
Pampers diapers suits my baby very well.. its absorbing capacity is good and my baby feels comfortable wearing pampers diapers.. more over my baby is 11 month old and i am using this product from his birth but he hasn't faced any rashes.. skin friendly... awesome quality..
"Very cheap and 3rd class quality of this pampers pants. Baby got rashes and red skin after using it. Bad experience with pampers pants. I am always buying Mamy poko pants. It's besttt product for babies skin. But because it was out of stock, i ordered pampers with same price rs 665. But very disappointed."
"Ordered this pampers XL baby pants diapers, shock to find them, they are duplicate, worst quality, not for use, it's fake product. With no exchange policy, we have no option but bear the cost of it & throw it away, as can't be of any use."
My kid got rashes on his lower back due to the quality of the pants not being good. I presume the packet I received would be from a very old stock due to which this has happened. All his excretes comes out of the pants thus making his clothes dirty.
"the fit is good,"
does its job without any whims and fancies
and a great product without any issues or hygiene problems
my baby loves it
The product is terrible I ordered this because I couldn’t find the ones I usually order for some reason. Anyways the leak! Reallly horrible I opened one packet and i would really like to exchange the other one with the usual pampers that I order.
The box was good initially. Even recommended it to a friend. However the last purchase proved to be a substandard product. The other reviews confirms my observations.  Stopped buying this altogether and switched to mamy poko
I bought this product ..had the worst experience ..it leaked and give my 2 month baby rashes all over the skin .. fake product .. harmful ..plus it's non refundable .total wastage of 1290 rupees.. Amazon guys gave unsatisfactory excuse that it is under non returnable item
best design compare to other top brands like huggies ..leak proof to some extent 5 stars to pampers
I have been using pampers for my baby and very happy with it . There is no leakage problem at all . Also my baby do not get rash and it’s very light diaper. It lasts all night so no worries at all. As it’s pant style I can easily make her wear it .
From 1 year continuous use. The best . Light weight from other brands. Good absorption. Less baby cry.
"Premium is better, next is this one. Buy and stock during offers and super value day to get maximum discount"
I have been using pampers from last 3 years and I am totally satisfied with the product. It never leaked and since my baby was not a very heavy wetter I have used this overnight as well and it works as it claims.
Pampers is THE best diapers for babies. Theres no second thought about that. I have been using pampers since my baby born and it never let me try any other brand. And the new range of Pampers is awesome
"I utterly dislike this diaper pants..they are getting leaked within 6 hour's,when babies pass their pee and motion. Actually I brought monthly megabox of 152 count medium sized which was failed case  with less obsorbency. It's tight which ends up in marks around thighs ."
This time the pampers quality was very bad. A foul smell of potty comes all the time. And ull increased the rates also this time. Not happy at all
Awesome product. By using it the baby is able to sleep comfortably and it's fitting I'd also too good. It is leak proof so the baby does not get disturbed. And also it is easy to use. Loved the product
"The Pampers which I purchased here, is very bad. I think it's a defective product because the Pampers purchased in a local store was good. But this is not at all useful. This doesn't absorb properly nor protect from leakage and skin inside the daiper will always be wet."
Its best for new borns. This helps them sleep better. They keep you baby happy for atleast 4 hours. The cranky babies normally behave so because of wetness in cotton nappies. These diapers are best.
"It's easy to wear and easy to pull off,Diaper is having silky soft inner layer which is very much comfortable to baby and there is no leakage issue "
"Soft, sturdy and good for all night sleep as it can absorb and keep the pee j side longer compare to other brand we have tried"
After 3 4 hours it smell very bad not because of baby pee but the blue cotton technology used in this smell very bad after 2 3 pee
Urine leakage after five hours very low quality you do not confuse 4 stars.Do not buy before i used huggies 12 hours then leakes.
"The diapers are very soft, even better than huggies. But, the absorbency was not upto the expectation or what the company claims."
size is smaller than actual size  and low quality bad idour smell also
Cheated by pampers its my second order
Frist one is good in all
"Pampers - the brand itself gives right name to the product, satisfaction is guaranteed."
The material is not that soft.. Also lot of white fibre is coming out from the inside part. Also have fitting issue with these regular pampers my baby gets lot of rashes and impressions on thighs whereas medium size of premium pampers is best fit for my lo.
"We use pamper since my lo was 7days old it will cm with wonderful fragrance,and very soft n leakage proof.. absorb fully..and the best thing about the product is skin friendly..this is what every mom is looking for..worth every penny.."
"Very nice product For kiddo & more comfortable for moms to change diapers, also gives dryness upto 6 hours. I am using it since last 3 months & delighted to use the product."
Disappointed with the newer version of Pampers. The quality of the product has been completely down. Most of the time it leaks.
We have been using this brand since our child's birth and this is our first worst experience with Pampers.
Horrific experience with the product looks like they would have cheated the duplicate one it caused rashes to my baby I’m not specific with any brand till date for my baby I used to use many brands but this one was horrible it lead to bumps also
Very good and soft diapers. I start repeating the same product after the first use.
Its cost per piece is also reasonable.
"Diapper rashes happens with pamper same problem discussed with many of my friends, switched to Mamy poko pants and the diaper rashes problem solved"
Looks like Duplicate product. Material and quality is too bad.. quality is far betyer when u purchase from other shops. Product is not returnable. Also no packaging at all. The diaper cover was torn in many places.Never biy from cloudtail india.
"We are using this product from last 6-8 months. However, this is first instance when low quality product is delivered. If try to adjust for child and diaper tears apart. We had to discard 5 from initial 10 diapers. As I have ordered 128 pack, need to see how remaining 118 works."
It's a great product for our little ones. Earlier I have used other diapers but this seemed to be of a better one when absorbency is concidered. Only thing that should be taken care is the size. Though my baby is 8.7kg when 7 months old I need to order XL instead of L
Product is leak proof .but the material is made of more plastic.it is not much soft as new born dampers
I used this product for my twins and sorry to say that this product is better option in comparison to others but still it causes rashes on my babies skin this could not be used for regular uses. But as I said better than others so I will buy the same again
"When I used for my baby, after an hour only baby skin was red and full of rashes. I used only 3/4 pads , and they r not taking return this packet. What can I do for whole packet , its fully non useable. We have ordered aloe Vera pads, but delivered normal."
I like other pampers this diaper was very tough and difficult to use. Had to stop using this for my babies because the elastic was too tight and making scars in their waist line
Pamper is the best quality diaper available in India.  I was used only pamper for my first child and now pamper for second inning as well.
Excellent product.. easy to use.. leakage proof and fast delivery. I have tried other brand of diapers. But I feel Pampers is the best with respect to leakage
"Very good product among Baby wipes in the market. the size is bigger & thicker then other, good amount of wetness that help clean & fresh the baby."
Using Pampers for my Baby from her Day......from NBS now M (7-12 KG) Diapers....Found proper delivery from Amazon with Reliable Products....no errors till now...I am satisfied with the Product and delivery services as on Date...and wishes more better further for a healthy Business Relation....
Seems to be a fake material using name of branded company coz after wearing it my baby start complaining of itching as well as it get leaked and doesn't long last as compared to the material/daiper that i usually purchased from market .
Very bad product
I am using pamper from  last 6 months nd try pamper mega monthly pack first time and got this is  cheap and useless. Total wastage of money.
Last few months i get very poor quality of pampers the baby has getting so much heavy rashes daily as compare to medical store i was buyed its perfect and from amazon total difference its poor quality not soak the liquid also not expect this . Really baby have badly rashes m not recommend this.
I ordered this product for my brother. I am so happy for amazon delivery and product quality. I'll recommend to all to use this soft pamper to give your baby a comfortable night. If you are searching for Pamper then you can go with this brand...
"It so easy to buy pamers from amazon and with ptime i get snext day delivery. The pamper pants are so good for my 2 years old daughter,i love this one this so so soft and comfortable never got any rashes after using them .My daughter wears them everyday and still she feels active all day"
Its a very god Indian product and I have been using it for both my kids and have never had any product related issues. Definitely worth the price online. I would always prefer to buy it in bulk.
Its really waste of money material is very thin and not holding more than 4 hrs. Its leaking outside after 4 to 5 hrs . I was using same product purchased  from market its diffrent quality as i feel
it is a great product material is soft so jo rashes and no tension too
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin form diaper reah and irritation
"Good Quality, Good Packaging, Good Delivery, Good Durability. Nothing to complain."
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body. No leakage and holds for long hours,even though it is much thinner. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my Neice.Overall the product is satisfying."
"Soft to the baby's skin. Although diapers have become unavoidable in modern times, they are made from recycling and goes through chemical processing, so use it wisely and don't make your baby wear it all the time. Check out for other natural options too."
"I used Pampers, Huggies and Mammy Poko Pants. For Night Pampers are best and for day Mammy Pants are."
Using pampers for the my child for the last one year. This one supplied is cheap product. Diaper leaking. may be fake product.
Amazing Quality..one of the best brand of baby pants today..highly recommended..!!
Very friendly to baby skin..!!..Go For It..!!
Best pants in the market today..!!
I ordeed it for my nephew....my daughter is 4 yrs now..i nvr used any other product other dn dis
Fabric is rally thin which is good when it’s summer to avoid rashes but in winters when baby pee a lot you need something thicker. These are like leaking and low absorption power. Not using it in future
Pampers is a very good brand for diapers. It's  very soft and leak proof. It's perfect for longer duration. Especially during nights. It locks the wetness inside. Size is perfect. Amazon delivery is on time. Moreover they are so many offers all the time. Loved the product
To be honest I have tried many brands for my baby but this is the best one available in market in quality and softness. Just buy it blindly.
For the last about 5 years I am ordering pampers but this is the first time that such a bad quality pampers have been received which are leaking.
I have been completely dissatisfied with this pampers product... The quality of the diaper is so bad... How can the quality dip so much... Very disappointed and would want to demand the money to be refunded at the earliest... No compromise in baby products absolutely...
This product is either fake or inferior quality and the pad is very thin compared to what I bought from local store
I am very disappointed with pampers 0amt style diapers because when my child rolls over it's leaking nd when she is having motions it's coming outside nd for couple of hrs also it's becoming very heavy and my child is getting diaper rash because of this
These pampers are having softness and also leakproof upto 3½ hrs. It having good absorbency materials in it. Nice product as excepted. it is also fit upto 2 years baby.
Good product... M using this product since one year.... Very happy with this product nd Amazon ws mind blowing delivered before time.... Grt work guys
Duplicate of original pampers.. Thats y i came to know why so much discount. I trapped in this discount play..dont buy this product... Its very thin than original product and it leaks also.. When u open this packet very first sight anybody can say it is duplicate.
I think my 6 mo baby is the most comfortable in Pampers pants diapers. Earlier we tried some other brands and were not satisfied. Thankfully we found Pampers pants diapers (couple of months ago) and all our problems of leakage and discomfort got solved ever since.
"Dear Friend,"
Never go the Lowest price to buy this monthly pack. The material quality is too worst. Maximum it lastening to 2 hrs only for baby. Hardly u can only difference of maxm 100 rupees for other brand.
Bad product in this price.
I bought this air channel model for the first time for my baby and I'm hugely disappointed bcoz this diaper tend to leak the urine from day 1 of usage.. I've made a wrong choice..😞
This is the most amazing diaper available in the market and very economical too. It's very soft and ideal to be used all night long without disturbing your baby's sleep.
"It's very comfortable for my baby,waist band is very easy to wear.No more leakage,travel friendly too"
I have been using Pampers since a long time. The material quality is really good. The most important thing is it is very easy to use.
The product is horrible.it is leaking.baby is totally wet and the microfibre is oozing out in no time.totally disappointed with my purchase of pampers baby dry pants.my baby has developed rashes and i am starting to believe that online buying pampers is not safe.
"Worst product. Less absorption,less soft seems like duplicate. Seriously rediculus how can someone manufacture worst quality product for small baby, shame on those people. Amazon should be responsible for quality check."
Very sad cut down on quality by pampers.
The previous version had much better absorption & holding capacity.
This diaper is very thin & hold very little.
"Very often , i observe leaking outside , which wasn't there in the previous model."
Perfect fitting for little sis..very comfortable through overnight..no leakage and very easy to use..
I have been using pampers since my boy was born. Had tried all its variant's and absolutely love how easy it is to use and last through the night. Till date there has been no case of diaper rash..I recommend it to all.
Am using this for my son since his birth from day one. The material quality is too good that it doesn't hurt his skin. It's very easy to use as it's pant type no chances of slippage and it's durable. Keeps baby dry for 10 to 12 hrs. It's a savior for new mommies
"It’s 3rd time we order from amazon same supplier, it’s original, no complaints."
"Was using same product for last few months , and was good quality. So I ordered from amazon. But this packet I bought from amazon contains defective diapers.. it’s leaking from the middle.. don’t know amazon is selling duplicate products or defective"
It's pampers... poor quality product.
Is good for maximum 2-3.
Air channel technology No use.
A big No to pampers heanceforth.
So nice product to buy for your baby.... my baby loves this product so much and it is leak proof for all night... absorbency is so so good... softness is like baby skin.... good for your baby
From past one year I am purchasing pempers dipers for my daughter
It so soft rashes free and leak proof
Same Product  as expected.Good quality.The best thing is the deal price.Thank you amazon.
"I'm using it almost for a year, recently i bought the new one and noticed the leakage from Pampers during Morning.  Not sure whether they have made any changes in it's design."
"The diaper is very soft and gentle to baby's skin, however it doesn't absorb for a long time. Hardly it works for 4hrs and then it becomes heavy. The absorbing capacity should be increased so that diaper can be worn for at least 8hours. Expected better quality."
Product is good and fit easily and didn't leak at all. Have always used this product once used mommy poco pants which have quality issue.
"I am an old customer of these diapers for having used them for my elder daughter and now for my son. The so-called improved version of these diaper pants is actually a degraded version. These new diapers are weak at the joints, get torned easily and absorbs less."
Worst diapers!! These are poor quality diapers. Leakage within 4-5 hrs of usage. Previous version of pampers was far better than this aloevera lotion version.
I was buying this till now but seems like the quality and durability is reduced. Not worthy for money . I started buying Huggies
It is not a original product. I have received the poor quality pampers. This is a cheap tactic used by Amazon and P&G fooling customers.bcoz this product is not returnable they can sell cheap quality.
Pampers PPL are losing trust on your brand.
Awsome product my baby is very happy to use it long lasting good product by pamaper
The quality is too too bad. It leaks and my baby does not remain dry. I doubt if it is the genuine and original quality because the same I also purchase from retail and it works fine. It is not and soft and gives rashes to the baby's body
Awosme Product. I have used different diapers for my baby and always had a feel to stick with one product which is safe for my baby and now i feel i can completly rely on Pampers and dont have to go for further research on which diaper to use for my little one
Actually I tried many types of diaper but when I switched to pampers I never changed it. I really like this product and my baby feels good and comfort in this.
"Excellent product!!! Must buy to every parents. Diaper is very soft the elastic around the waist don’t leave any impression on my baby’s skin, the alo vera gel helps to protect my baby’s delicate skin from rashes and the pants are very east to use."
"Buy online, come from good brand, I love this product yeh sent very well, he came on time"
"Am a regular buyer of Pamper Pants, which were too good for my child but this time the new pamper pant is getting leaked after just 3-4 hours... a small  adjustment with quality...."
"I'm using pampers for almost last 2 years for my baby and it's one of the best diaper pants. But last time, the package we receive is worst in material quality. It tore while even putting it up. Also it was leaking very frequently in just 2 hrs from one side."
I have been using this item for my grandson since over a year and that sums up the matter in a positive light.
Pampers are my favorite diapers for my kids. Whole night my kids sleeps well. No leakage.
Used mamypoko pants and pampers for my kid .. mamypoko pants are on positive side .... Not bad product anyways
Worst of the diapers ..I have ever used for my daughter... It may appears as a Gud deal while buying... But thinnest material... once in use  its Always wet...  Develops rashes and redness around butt..it's not about money.. just don't even use it for free...
Amazing Quality..one of the best brand of baby pants today..highly recommended..!!
Very friendly to baby skin..!!..Go For It..!!
Best pants in the market today..!!
Pampers is the best in diapers. My baby is more comfortable in tape  style diaper
I never faced leakage issue with pampers.. I almost using it for 4 years right from my elder baby to younger baby. For 12 months kid it’s absorbency is too poor. I don’t blame pampers product but I am confident that delivered product is not virgin
"Drastically dicresed the quality of product in last two months leakage and earlier every new piece with good frangnance , completely frastuated now and moving to other brand after being loal customer to Pampers from last 18 months. Bye bye Pampers"
Good product
Pampers were casing skin allergy for my baby and I have change that pamper with in the time of every 4hrs but I do know why it has happen. We buying Pampers only that it's no.1 choose of doctors but why it was happen. If it repeated I will change the product
Good one but not best as premium care
Awesome product with great result I think this is the best product i have ever used till now best product i am certified by the company
Generally Pampers is good product but this time for every two diaper I find one diaper is leaky. I am not sure if there is any duplicate in this but previous pack quality was so good but this pack quality is so disappointing.
Wow these are very comfort for my baby.. these are very soft . No leaks. Totally satisfied.
This diapers are simple with less capacity.
The wetness remains there for few minutes before absorbing all urine hence it's irritating for kids.
It's quality is saggy once absorbing capacity is completed.
good packing.. dependable.. some of them are tearing quickly while putting on..
It's a great product for your babies.. as it's comfortable and leakproof.. No rashes on skin...for uninterrupted sleep must buy this...
Good
Fake product it is genuine pdt. Of pamper...it leaks everytime and i need to use 6 to 7 diapers in ome night..so it is totally awastage to buy pampers through amazon
"the quality of this product is very cheap, despite changing diapers around 9-10 pm, my baby's pants would get wet ( sheets as well)  by midnight, the diaper not only gets full fast but also causes leaking!"
It's really good product very soft and water proof no chance for leakege
Kul milakr it's best
"utterly disappointed with the size its like medium only, material and everything is ok but my issue is with the size."
Best quality easy  absorbent skin friendly comfortable to child.Baby feels comfortable.Thank Amazon.
Its totally a fake product. It's very thin and getting teared while wearing it to  my kid itself. First time I'm experiencing like this.
Not socking as said... only 1 glass of water can be obserb... then it wil come out
The product is not at all comfortable
Elastic is very tight on waist and thighs
My son is 5.3 kg and still he is not finding it comfortable to wear pants
I won't buy the product again
And the worst thing is it does not have return policy 😤
It leaked very easily within 2 hrs :(. Don't buy any more. trust me i am very disappointed with this purchase. i was using using huggies some one told me to use pampers but my decision was wrong. again i will go for huggies
M vry possessive for my 1n half yr daughter..her skin r vry much sensitive. .when I was switch other brand to pamper. M very much care free. .absorption level higher..comfortable elastic ..n nw come with aloe vera..
why you giving duplicate pampers everytime when i bought it from store it’s totally different as per size design durability everything different. store one are very good in quality as per ur pampers are just worst
It's absorption is really bad . We have used pampers earlier also but never faced this problem . This time baby requires change after every 2-3 hours
This Diaper is good for may one hour. For overnight lasting it’s better to go for premium. My kids motion flows out of Diaper sometimes.
Product is so soft and feels so comfort to the baby..at first i used tonuse another brand of daipers..but that made my baby's bum red and rashes..so i shifted to pampers..this made my baby comfront and now he ia sleeping great at night without any leakages
It is not leak proof as claimed in advertising.  Don't buy this poor product. Amazon charges are High due to packing and delivery charges. Compare before you buy.
Pampers is probably the closest thing to cloth diapering you'll find in a disposable with advanced Earth-friendly features. This company has set new environmental standards for diapers while keeping baby's health in mind. The best part is Not only is it green but it has higest  absorption till 12 hrs.
"Using from last 3 years for my SON, very good product and works for more than 6-8 hours in a day time. No skin rash issue as of now."
Don't buy its wasn't upto expecting... It's was old stock... Couldn't soak properly. Every one hour n or on first urinal we have to change the diaper... Please pamper change the quality
This Pampers L size is having very poor quality and very thin and leaking very much .. really it is very very bad... previously I have used medium size Pampers that was too good..but this time very wost loss of money.
Really bad
Product is good but some diapers are very thin. Overall it is a good deal in this price as compared to local market. Go for it.
"I don't know I have been using the Pampers since long time but this is the 1st time I'm facing the leakage problem, Such a worst diapers I have never been seen before."
I have tried all brands and Pampers are the best. I'm using this for my twin baby from birth and now they are 2 yrs and still continuing.
"diaper is the essential for the babies and in short span of 14 months this became my favorite , this is so leakage proof and i am using this for whole night and day and there is no issue i am facing with this, would surely recommend."
"Got 172 for less than 1300, does there job as expected. Not recommended for long duration use as it may leak."
I am a regular pampers pants user. I have three kids and have been using it for the past 7 years..
This is the first time I have purchased online and what I have received is a complete knock off. Very poor material quality and it 'leaks'.
Using pampers such long time but this time something wrong with the diapers..feels such bad quality taken in hand and not working up to mark ..baby feels so uncomfortable after small period of time ..dont purchase from this vendor..
Material is very soft and comfortable for child. It has 12 hours absorbency and not leaking for 12 to 14 hours ....
"I am not satisfied, I am using Amazon products, above four years, this product very very worst, product not quality and quantities, please return my money & materials taken. Thank you."
I didn't like it. Though it says XL but it's not actual. I was using other brand for my kid same size was good. Now with this Pampers it's leaking and my kid is not comfortable and size is small as compare to other brands.
"Disappointed with this product from Amazon, more particularly from pampers.  I don't know whether it is an old stock or duplicate stock. My previous experience with pampers is that their product quality is very good. So I was surprised to find the cheap quality of the product once I started using it for my baby."
This product is too good for baby its a absorbency is too good there is no leakage and very comfortable for babies I would like to recommend this to all my frnds and circle
"Quality of the diapers is worst, it's leaking in 1 hr. Seems like low quality and old or expired product has been delivered in the name of discount. Last also had same problem with the product. Really bad and utterly disappointed, please provide quality."
This product is not virginal. Worst quality. The pamper is very thin. Am not expecting Amazon selling such kind of product...
Size is very small it is not a xl one... Many times i ordered in amazon i got good one.. but this time not am so upsettttt......
"The product and the service has been extremely good,but Iam facing a problem with the size.My baby has outgrown the size of the diaper(S) that’s been delivered.The packing is untampered,so kindly see if an exchange (to M size) is possible."
Thank you
"I have been using pampers diaper pants for my 5 month old. it not only keeps her dry, saves her pajamas from getting dirty too (Now that she has started turning around). we tried few other brands before finally settling to this one. will highly recommend"
"I used for my infant, this last six to seven months, day by day it's going more thinner, these can protect only one hour.. after that it's totally wet, it is not use able more than one hour.  next time I will change to mummyspoko...nappy for my baby....."
"Comparing with mammypoko pants not even worth for 2 rating. It cannot work for 10 hours. I thought of returning product, but unfortunately it is not eligible for it. Best choice would be mammypoko pants instead."
We are using Pampers for our baby ever since he born. First time we ordered 152 monthly pack. Quality of these diapers is very poor. Daipers are very thin and getting filled very quickly. This is not the case earlier. Not satisfied this time.
Overall quality is high...tried several brand diapers but finally into pampers..price wise its costly bt for babies safe side .i would recommend this diaper..try to buy when offer is available
"Ever since the company launched their new technology of air , the urine smell comes out even if the diaper is half full"
I have been using pampers for my baby since birth. But this time the product I received seems to be fake. It's not leak proof at all. She started having diaper rash for the first time. How can I check the authenticity of a product?
"Diapers are so soft and stretchable too. It is very comfortable for babies , quality is very good and it there is no lekage too."
The material is kind of hard and rough.
Can we have the wetness indicator for this too? Like you give for NB
Woww best quality & smell. Its enriched with Aloe Vera and lotion. No rashes. Better then Mamy Poko Product
Have Been using it from the Day my Baby is Born..
BLEESED WITH IT
would be perfect to describe it....
No rashes... no leakeage... durable.
Very bad quality i never expected this from Pampers
Now I'm using Himalayan
"Received duplicate diapers when ordered monthly pack, useless no absorption."
Personal suggestion is not to take monthly packs(112).
"This time the quality was pathetic, i compared it with the earlier lot."
Every night my son is getting wet due to diaper getting leaked every time he urinated.
I shall surely raise it to pampers also. I want my money to be refunded.
"Love this pampers and my daughter love it too.. I was using other diaper before pampers and my daughter got rashes, it leaks at night and need to change.. but when I used pampers I can get a good night sleep.. no rashes.."
"I am a regular pamper buyer, usually purchase them offline. When i Ordered first time through amazon product was ok but this time my exp is not at all good. Amazon delivered duplicate product to me..d"
"Good product specially for finicky toddlers. The design on diaper helps fool them to put it on and  good absorbency is definitely welcome. Leak proof, yes and also super soft. It's light weight as well if I compare to other brand."
I have been using Pampers pants for my son since his birth. And I must say they are really easy to use and most comfortable diapers. They never give rashes to my baby's soft skin and keeps him happy.Thank you 😊
Nice and comfortable product for babies. Really profitable than buying two or three pieces from retail shops.
The product is very good i am using it for my baby from day 1 ... and no rashes nothing very good product i would prefer for all to use this for infants in nights so baby can sleep peacefully ... also i use in daytime instead of clothes thank u pampers
"Pampers Diapers Pants is the best product. Well done Pampers. A happy mum here, these nappies are also very comfortable and flexible for my little wriggler. Highly recommended. Absorbency is high.Leak proof also.Very soft product."
"We we’re using Pampers Active baby till now, with this purchase we started using diaper pants. For the first time we noticed rashes on the baby’s skin. Scent of the diapers is also very strong. Diapers are very thin or delicate get torn while putting diapers on."
"New pampers pant style diapers are the best.they are leak proof,rash free n easy to use.they are very comfortable.love it"
"Pampers dry pants are very comfortably fits, material is very soft and helps to  protect baby's skin. Must try it for your baby."
Good
"This Product is awesome,"
-Soft Layer at inside.
-Absorb better than the competitors
-A must buy I can say
-Price is also Good
New pampers are worst than the old one
Pampers older version was good...bt this new version is of total waste...it couldn't withstand for atleast 3 hrs...
"Very nice product. Fully comfortable Elastic , not bad for skin, easy to wear etc."
The material quality is good. It absorbs overnight pee. The product is durable. No leak issue. And yes very easy to use.
got good deal #599...  Very durable..  Stands whole night without rashes and no leakage at all...  Easy to put and remove...
Very disappointed with the quality. I am regular customer and have purchased the same size and same make earlier also. This time I ordered big bag but the diapers are leaking. Baby is getting uneasy from it. Please look into this matterand get it exchanged.
Please get the inventory checked. The quality of diapers is very bad and they do not seem to be original. Leaking and getting heavy in almost no time.
"It could use for only few hours max 4 to 5 hours,mean time diaper fill with urine .Tesco is good brand"
The upper back side of daiper becomes sticky n watery whenever the baby poops. Rest it all good compare to mammy poko and himalaya. And also hard to dispose the inside gel as some part of kerala plastics are not taken by waste management.
"I have been using Pamper pants for the last two years, but this time Amazon has sent me something duplicate I suppose. It never soaks. And every night we are experiencing a wet bed. Am surprised that Amazon is not maintaining its quality."
"Thanks amazon for providing such a good packing , about pamper It is too good ! Softness feel to child."
Best option for children
Very Good quality with best packing
Excellent product ..In reasonable price.. awsome qualities .. easy to use. Good Packing...!
Purchased Large size but its looks small size and not fit to my kid whose weight is 11kgs. Very low quality compared to previous one. Quality not adequate
Got low quality pampers or duplicate better to buy in stores from now...
"Very good for my baby girl diaper for using for 4_5 hrs, little medicated for diaper rashes, very happy aftet using the product"
Very bad experience.product leaking ...i had better expereince with snuggles
not for long term use gel filled and stick on to baby’s buttocks.. got duplicate item this time
Good for babies. Absorbency is good and most importantly it's leak proof and very soft.  Very useful for newborn babies..
It is a fake product
Even after my son wearing pampers his bed will be wet because of poor and fake quality of pampers
Its easily  heavy in very less time not last longer for 12hrs its leakage urine and pant become wet ...not recomnded for 9kg weight also not fit to my baby its tight on thighs very very disappointed with pampers pant 👎👎👎👎
Nice product with good absorbing capacity and no leakage. Keep babies dry and hygienic.Its very soft like cotton so baby feels good and comfortable .
"I'm a regular purchaser of Pampers through Amazon, speed delivery good price"
the product is amazing easy to use well packed and best product very very good product every person should buy from that seller only best seller with best product
It's cheaper than others when only you subscribed it monthly or else. Good product. I subscribed it monthly.
"I don't recommend pampers as they are not leak proof,only 1 out 10 is having good quality and rest have leaks in the subscription box mainly. Try other brands for babies instead of wasting money on these."
Some pampers are very fast absorbs And leaks. Better go for the retail store for pampers.
"Pls don't buy this product. It is waste of money. Quality of product in 32 nos, are much better than this low quality 64 nos."
The new pamper pants is easy to use and so comfortable. I just have to slip it on my baby and forget about leaks and frequent checkings(my baby poops only once in 2-3 days) until its time to remove it which is usually 10-11 hours! Superb product!
"Very much satisfied with the product. Good packing, good quality and easy to use plus comfortable for my baby girl. Moreover, cost is something I felt happy as a mother ;Rs 679 for 76 good quality panties is something that have to be mentioned 😍"
The diapers are easy to use and super absorbing let my baby sleep peacefully throughout the night
I am a follower of pampers for past 6years i used it for first child then after my second child i also continued  wid it .the size is perfect leak proof no rashes issue all make me stick to pampers though there are so many options i go for pamper
"Been regular buyer, on time delivery from amazon and quality is amazing"
"I have been using pamper since 2 yrs for my son. And as it is quite reasonably price at amazon, i usually buy it from here only."
From last 2-3 times i have noticed that the quality of daiper is very poor. It doesn't seems like an original product to me.
Pants are too small for 4 month old baby . And don't keep your baby for longer hour in the diaper as it doesn't absorb much.
It was a waste product from Amazon pls don't buy anyone I hate Amazon from now onwards I didn't expect this type of cheap quality products  from Amazon. There is no return policy for this item finally it was a worst product
"Since birth I am using pampers pant for my son. Now he is 11 months old it's absorbency is superb, very soft for babies sensitive skin,. No leakage problem.i use large pack (86) so it's cost is in budget.. I only recommend papers pant."
"I live outside India, this is not the product expecting. It's much difference in same product in comparison."
"Good product, with nice absorption capacity.. have been using it for my baby since she was 6 months old. My lil one doesn't make a fuss..when we put her on in it."
The diaper is most comfortable. It's leakproof and very soft. It's coverage is good. It fits easily.
Gud product..using for my son.no leakage..soft one.price ws  reasonable..bt saw more offers for pampers large size pants 64 count in other sites..so do check tge offers  well before buying..otherwise gud product.
Its a fake product. Please dont buy it. After2hrs u have to change the diapers as material is thin. Original  product isnot like that. Didnt expect this from Amazon. Disappointed  😡😡
The product that I received on the name of Pampers Diaper pants is horrible.
In fact it is a fake product. The touch and feel of the product only tells you the cheap quality of it.
Highly disappointed.
Pls do not buy this product
"Pampers has been a choice of zillion parents. Quality, excellence and product knowlege makes it my first choice, specially given it comes with aloe advantage."
Happy Pampering..!
-this ideally should be your tagline:-)
I have a monthly subscription where 2 packs are delivered in a cartoon. This time both the packets inside the cartoon were cut exactly in the middle.
I have been using it for my baby for the past 2 years and the quality is very good. Soft and good absorbency.
I would recommend pamper pants.
The new Pampers is not at all good... It leaks just after 2 to 3 hrs.... Very dissatisfied with the product. The old one was much better... Never faced such a problem.
"Initially i was skeptical as my kid has a problem for rash if the quality is compromised, however that wasn't an issue at all. The product is fantastic and is value for money."
I've been using pampers diapers for my boy for last two years. I chose amazon to buy them from. This time got a low quality diaper(which seems to be a duplicate one) which leaks after each pee. My family lost belief in pampers and chose huggies for my new born baby.
the worst product of pampers..highly disappointed with its leakage..pampers magic gel diapers were very satisfactory..pampers pant are waste of money..Not going to buy it ever again..
"This diaper is very small in sizes and thin as compared to other, material quality is not good this diaper breaks all his promises and it's leak we have to change the diaper very frequently, 100% not recommended"
"I have been using pampers since one year and happy to say that it is soft on baby's skin, no leakage, goes on for long time, absorbs for long time, protection against rashes. High quality and best prices are available on Amazon only"
Very poor product. Night have change the diaper 7 times because the diaper gets wet after once or maximum twice the baby pee. Very poor quality.
I have used many other brands but I find pampers are best. The price is little higher.. but softness/light weight/absorption on point. When it is used for 8 -10 hours then you may find leakage depends on baby's pee count.
I have been a regular buyer of this and it has never disappointed me.my baby feels comfortable n never had rashes.i m happy with this.
I have purchased the product many time.
But this time quality of product is very poor.
"I am using Pampers from one year and from couple of months buying Pampers monthly mega box pack. But first time, I am facing product quality issue."
"Fit well and absorb very well. I am satisfied, I'll buy regularly"
"I love pamper,  a reliable brand..its diappers r very soft with great absorbency and lovely fragrance... After few hours ⌛ they r still light in weight♎"
"Fully Leak proof, very soft fabric and premium elastic. Delivery was fast than expected."
now a days these pampers are not upto mark..it was not durable..quality was low after they upgraded their product..
"Qualiry bad , i ordered medium size, but i received very thin n ti8 fitting item i received.. When my baby 3months old i purched pampers pants quatility gud dats y i ordered pampers but im not satisfy"
Worst product. It doest not soak and leaks all over. Infact my baby got cold because of he was on wet diaper entire night. I don't understand why this product is even made.
Good quality happy with this product it's genuine and good price. Good observing self satisfy
Such a poor quality and leaking issue. Not durable at all. M surprised y amazon sells such bad quality items. They should have quality check process.
Its waste of ₹700/
The quality of the new pampers is really bad. They tear very easily and barely last a few hours. Did I receive a fake product?
very cheap quality.....logo ko bsss bewkoof bnate h .....isme sare pampers me leakage ho jata h.....
Amazing product. Apart above said qualities best part is antirash. As we are using it from the birth of my daughter. She's happy and above all antirash free.
Very good wipes I m so happy becoz it's very soft and comfortable for baby's easy to clean and easy to use very good.
Size seems to be small and it's started leaking  after 3-4 hours of use for my 3 year old daughter. This has never happened in the past orders.
"Great product, good experience. But feeling like it should have more qualified. Packaging wasn't upto the mark, but received clean."
"It is nice brand of diapers like I used it for my baby it is safe for her as well as no ,it leakage it's really nice."
Poor quality item..New pampers with air channel is big flop.....It is leaking urine also from diaper not only air.
I liked the product. It is really comfortable for children. It is soft and leak proof too.
"One of the best solutions while travelling with baby,absorbency on point while softness is perfect.Highly recommended product . At beginning i was not much interested,but very soon it won my confidence as it is rash free as well."
I don't understand what is happening to this product?? I am thatmuch unhappy with this as it starts to leak 2-3hrs after use at even while baby is sleeping...not 1 time... this is my 5th experience.
Is ther any way i can give u 0 star?
"I didn’t expect papmers to have such low quality material... diaper literally feels like a plastic bag and the inside part is also wet all the time, baby’s skin gets rashed and wrinkled... the old pamper diapers with straps were much better"
We have ordered L size daipers on box & pack it is L size but daiper quality was like small with in 2 to 3 hours it was leaking previous I have ordered it was good but not it not satisfied.
I want it to exchange it tell me the process.
Very soft and smooth pampers are the perfect fix for kids and gives more comfort.
I use this product since 1 year and its very good product. But this new version of air soft pamper is not having enough durability it will sustain 5 to 6 hours can't use overnight. And material quality aslo not good compared to previous product.
The product looks duplicate. The diapers are leaking in 2 hrs only. 1 side of the diapers become full and leak out while the back side stays absolutely thin. For sure these are duplicate pampers. Will not buy diapers online again
Good offer. Product has good quality and ni leakage found. Worth buying it.
"I dislike this new produc because it's durability is less and lickage occure, contains less amount and swate..which make my child cold and sick...previously i purchase XL pamper pant which is very usuful and contains more"
"Sometimes it leaked, rashes on my baby skin. But otherwise it's good axept other diapers"
One of the best diapers I have come across. Many of my friends suggested me to go for other brand but I chose this product and the results are excellent.Thanks Amazon for the wonder offer and discount .Thanks team Diapers.
Very good and nice packaging.very helpfully for may baby.good intiative by pampers
Half of the diapers were easily torn soon after wearing by child due to bad leak proof and inadequate absorption. I think the product were not original or as per the standards we get when we buy the same product from nearby medical stores.
Good product.
Till sterday I had used Pampers premium care small size pants.my boy is heavy wetter.he is nearing 6 months.so chose baby dry medium size.its perfectly fit for my boy.
No rashes at all in Pampers products
Can not hold wetness for more than 3hours.
If some how left for more than that then my baby gets wet and wattery.  Even leaks
Overall Nice product.... it prevent leakage...keep dry whole night...go for it... packaging is good..... delivery by Amazon is very good.... original product... All item are in good condition
Elasticity of the material may be improved. Liquid absorption quality can be improved.
My baby is one year and for the first time she got rashes....it does not absorb...in first pee itself the bump is fully wet...the inner is nylon....
i ordered for my nephew and it's long lasting. leak proof product easy to use best quality.
Best product ever seen in this section...Pamper keep ur quality n quantity maintained in this price range....Parents go for it...
As my son pees more so it gets fills in less than 2.5 hours.. Overall good..good packaging n very fast delivery
Baby had diaper rashes after using this. So stopped using this then I went for premium extra absorption diaper pants which we usually order but due to non availability had to order this. Material is too poor. NOT  recommended at all.
"The diaper does it's job, but feels very plastic-iky and rough on adult skin, so am sure it is uncomfortable for an infant."
Good
Not so good. Material is very bad.. not original pampers.. all wetness collected at one place
The quality of this product is much better from others.
Kids feel comfortable while wearing it & also it lasts for good 5-6 hours.
"Back side should be slightly loose by 12 mm ,so that potty can not comes out"
Pampers is always my go to brand for my little one. He feels comfortable and sleeps well during nights
Looks like duplicate product. Becomes heavy within 2 hours. We had used pampers medium size before that was better but large size is absolute waste. No use of using these diapers.
"Very good product must say, Really soft on baby’s skin Also it is leak proof and aborts really good. My nephew sleeps full night very comfortably."
"It is easy to use and do not leave rashes on baby's body. But it is not durable, it leaks in 2-4 hours."
It leaks very often. I don't like the smell plus need to change it in very short span.
I have been using Pampers since he was five months and I totally recommend it. It's good.
The worst pack of nappies I have ever used from Pampers. The material is so flimsy and the padding at the back is so minimal (coveres only to the line pointed in the picture) allowing poo leak everytime soiling clothes. I demand a refund.
Me and my wife liked the product as we are doctors by profession. My daughter somewhat did not like it as the look of the diaper was not the same from the previous pampers diaper which we use to buy for her. But the product overall is the best for kids.
I've been using pamper pants for my baby for quite a long time. These diapers are thin and soft and doesn't irritate the baby. The quality is too good and didn't cause redness or rashes so far. I'm really impressed with the diaper pants
Are these XL size? These are nothing but medium size pants . If you compare with other brands xl size pants these are smaller. Other brands medium size and pamper xl size is nothing but the same. Will somebody from pampers explain this?
"Very bad experience. Very few hours work. Not useful for night sleep. I find my baby wet in morning mostly, so Better use many poko or Huggies. I used L size."
Pampers new dry pants are best for babies. This product is very good in terms of quality. Good absorbing power with new design. Comfortable fit for baby. Satisfied with this product. Good product. Highly recommended.
"Guys, i bought this product in an offer, I think its not genuine and can harm your kids, So please careful and try to avoid, Its get wet very quickly and the product quality is different than the one we get from local shops."
"I have been using pampers diapers for my baby since 9 months, but the diapers of this pack are not of good quality n result in very quick leaks. I don't know if the material of the diapers has cheap or this stock is defective"
I dont like the packing one pack was torn I dont know if it is safe to use or not. Return is very difficult from our area.
We have been using pampers for our baby for the past 5 years and there's no problem to reveal regarding this product
Since the birth of my son we use only Pamper diaper. It is a good one.
I have been using this pampers From the very beginning of my little daughter's birth.Its very soft and comfortable.best nappy i have ever.it keeps my baby dry .
Large size version of pampers don't absorb much like medium or small.  But it's good for this price.
No complains.
Really like the product. No false claims.
Good product. Huggies gave me a tough time so I tried Pampers for my baby and it's way better. Absorbs more and can be used for long.
Great product.  It doesn't leak and holds quite much liquid. It works for 12 hours with no issues but its a rare case. Never let a child wear diaper for than long until its absolutely necessary.
Worse product. Quality was not at all good.its like a wrap.As per description size was large but It suits for 5 kgs baby not for 9+ kgs kid. Baby wont feel comfortable with this cheap worst product.observed rash for my baby.
"Best part which i like is non leakage. It observes and dries very fast. My baby is 10kgs and i was using Medium size pampers which starts leaking, if he passess urine more than 2 times. Now after using Large size it lasts more than 8hrs"
"This product from pampers is of very very very bad quality, pls don't buy it, it's all waste of money."
"I bought it because i read good reviews, but after using the product, I'm not satisfied at all."
"If you are using other brand and switch to Pampers XL Please re-check the size, otherwise not use of."
The product seems fake as it keeps leaking.  I normally buy from shop and use this but I faced no problem.  This product from Amazon is not a good quality.
"Once or twice felt some pieces are kind of substandard,  might be duplicated products mixed up????"
It's a fake pampers.Leaks within two hours only.Gets torn and the gel comes out in every use.
The diaper gets filled up/heavy in less than 2 hours. This is the first time we have faced such an issue with pampers diapers.
Nice product form Pampers . Thank you Amazon for delivering such amazing products
"These daipers are far better than other diapers in terms of flexibility , leakage and rashes. So i would suggest  to use these diapers for your baby comfort. I had already used so many diaper brands but this one is durable. Thanks..."
I have been using Pampers since the beginning of birth of my daughter. Very soft on the skin . No leaks if you change it regular intervals. Minus one star because there's no pee indicator on the basic diapers
We are using pampers ever since our baby was born. These diapers are really soft and have great absorbency and we hardly observed any leakage ever. So all in all the best diapers for the baby.
"Very good product from pamper and pricing is less than other stores, quality is good"
"Very good quality, got back to pampers after going through 2 other brands. Satisfied"
"In night two pad used because pad leak and urine  spread on bed than baby cry company said,12 hrs urine absorbing capacity gives complete sleep"
"Oh God! They are horrible, i feel even a kitchen towel can absorb more than what these diapers did, they didn't even contain one wee. Either these were fake or pampers'  quality has deteriorated a lot."
I don't like this diapers bcuz it's too thin comparison to local shop diapers its nt absorbable for 3hours it's a fake one..m..nt satisfied after using diz pant plz don't order diz.its a waste of money
Does the job nicely.
Using it for my 1 yr old child.
"Used for 8 hours straight, still not much heavy."
"Also leakproof, you need to adjust it properly."
Also evenly distributed weight.
"Am using this for my little one and pampers are best among all. Very soft, comfortable, easy to use and leak free."
happy with the quality
my baby likes very much and feels comfortable
Not satisfied with the product..very thin n it leaks..felt cheated..This was my second purchase of Pampers diapers from Amazon..the first product was satisfying but the second one very dissapointing..Didn't expect this from a brand like pampers.
Have been using them since the birth of my little one - 2 years to be precise... This is a savior...baby is always dry... Material is very good... My older one would get diaper rash all the time but these pamper pants are amazing...
"The pampers are truely the softest Diapers ever... The waist is so soft that it doesn't leave any mark on my baby's waist, plus the absorbency is too good, controls odour... On an all the best among all other Diaper brands."
"Very nice product. Bought for my niece and it's very good.. good absorbent, no leakages or rashes"
I am writing review after 3 days use and i am surprised to see Its absorbency.it has no likage and also very soft and also fitting is one of the most important factor and it fits with age of children generally.
Very very worst product and duplicate product in Amazon .In.
Amazon pls reject this item in your product list for baby product.
Pls don't cheating like this and dnt lie that product is very very worst for children usage.
Back side ka upri hissa kamar vala bhag gila ho jata h . jisse bachhe uncomfortable mahsus karte hn. I min rona suru kr dete hn.
Thoda changes ki avskta h baki thik h.
"Not sure if this product is genuine, the tag marks (numbers) that are in black on the diaper were missing in them, also stark differences in the material. Will not buy agin from this seller."
Though the package was delivered in Pampers package but this is the first time I have ever seen product is not up to the mark and a very cheap product has been handed to me
I use it for my baby during night in summer season and it's good. He is 2 years old and this diaper works till morning with no leakage.
These pants have worked perfectly for my kid. No leakage and good absorbtion has made our life easier. Also thanks to Amazon for providing the product with great discount every time I buy.
Tried every brand at the beginning .Nothing beats pampers
I have a feeling it's fake.  Lot of leakage issues ...
I don't know why they have discontinued the previous  baby dry pants ..it was so good
Don't like the air channel
It's quality is good.. very soft for the baby skin.. leak proof.. absorbing capacity is also good.. holds good for 7-10 hours
Very happy with the product quality and it's absorb capacity with leak proof and soft to baby.
I would never ever compromise on the comfort of my baby .but what I love most about pampers premium care pants is the scurve.it let's my baby explore everything without fidgeting with the diaper
"It's awesome product, It's Very comfortable & Good for little baby special in Leak proof and softness."
"My baby is using , No one single complaints from this Pampers ."
Thanks for giving such quality .
"These are just one step far from perfect, only thing is the medium size  leaves the tight marks,so we make the elastic loose by stretching before putting it on."
"Used to buy this product regularly but in the last two purchase the product is of very low quality, ,it is not lasting for more than one or two  episodes of urine passing, frequently leaking very dissapointed"
This product is fake I'm not happy with this product the diaper gets teared when my baby wear's also quality is too bad and it gets wet and water comes out
IT ABSORBENCY IS REALLY GOOD AS COMPARED TO OTHER DIAPERS. IT LOOKS ALL THE WETNESS AND ITS FITTING IS REALLY GOOD THE BABY CAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND THERE IS NO RASHES AFTER USING PAMPERS DIAPERS. THE PRODUCT IS REALLY GOOD.
I  have always used Pampers diapers for my daughter .  They are the best.  My baby was comfortable and happy. No leaking.  Fitting is also good.  Recommend this to other mommies.
"Had been purchasing this since almost an year however appears the quality has drastically dropped as XL is appearing as if written over the quality which was for large , result is it gets wet quickly . This would be last shop for pampers"
The quality of the product that came in this order is bad compared to the order i made earlier from the same seller. The product is very thin and easily gets torn while putting it on the baby.
Am regular user of pampers pants. This new model s cheap quality. Size is less than the old model. My son had severe diaper rash within one day of use . Not going to use it anymore.
Get the old xl pant model
Leak and bed wetting noticed on regular basis during night hours.
I liked it very much and have been using it for the last one year and have no complaint at all.
The material is below standards.....recomend not to buy......when i tried to make my baby wear the diaper the quality was sooooo bad it tore....similar pamers that i orderd earlier (3+time ) were good but this time its horrible.
I received two packs of this product one quality is always good but the another one we have getting some problems regarding dipers not good randomly. Facing problem like leakage in product. So so the needful
We have using it for now almost 7 months for our baby and it is genuinely good product. No rashes and has good absorption rate.
Its not good like before. Getting wet and leak outside very fast. Double quantity required daily than before. Bad experiance.
pampers is one of the best brands as we all know and it proves it every time. It keeps the baby dry whole night and there no tension of leakage or rashes. Baby sleeps in peace and so does the mommy
"Very nice material good for kids , value for money product and we can always trust pamper diapers for babies as its give comfort to child and very easy 2 carry as its of very light weight And very soft for baby's skin"
Awesome product.... No complaint.... using since the birth of my baby.....👍👍👍👍👍
Hi. I am a prime customer and buying pampers for my kid ever since he is born. This time I have received very poor quality pampers which leak often and fill v fast. Even there appearance is substandard. Disappointed this time !
"Pampers AIR the worst product ever,Buyers plz dont buy this product,this will last upto maximum 3 hours and after that it will definitely leaks !"
"I am not at all satisfied with the product as It differs in Size, comfort, quality and durability from the pampers diaper pants normal (not monthly) pack."
May I know why there is difference in same brand product?
I like product.it is same like 24rs pack.I am very happy for discount.
I use this diapers day and night (2 diapers).no rashes.but in baby edges area is litl bit red line.I suggest buy here in discount.
"The diaper making leakage problem,the price is low but the product is duplicate,I'll never buy it again.."
My wife always prefers this for 9 months now. Never had an issue or nasty experience
Material quality became pooer than before. Soaking power is not as good as it was previously. Quality should improve as it's priced.
Good product.. keeps the baby dry for a long hours. Leak proof diaper
I have always used pampers for my baby.one diaper is enough for one night.material is okay with baby’s skin too
"Worst quality I ever used for my children .Absorbing capacity is low ,chances of rashes is more ....Don't buy.Old one was nice to use .......Whole night ..No problem but new one is too worst."
"product quality is awesome. New Diaper pants easy to use. I have been using pampers since long, price is cheap compared to offline stores. Happy with amazon fast delivery, got product on next day."
"Quality of material is good, light weight and my baby is happy all the time with this diapers"
Very easy to use. Among all products this is best in price point. Always buy 64 or 56 package. More economical than others. 64 package pricingvarying between 630 to 720.
Excellent
The side frill which creates rashes on thigh. It must be too soft.
My nephew was born premature and so he is tiny nothing fits him but these are really nice and yet they are taped they fit well
"Amazing product. Lasts whole night.i have tried other company diaper pants as well for my baby but this is best of all and i have been using since she's born. No leakage, no rashes, easy to wear and remove"
"Pamper used for my baby last two months.Its nice product like mamy poko pants .Mamy poko pants used for kids last 3 years .First time used pampered for kids .It's very nice .no rashes,no leakage."
Nice product but quality differs from what is available in the market.
These are fake pampers. As absorbancy is only for 2 hours max. After that leakage problem is there. If we buy pampers frm market after 10-12 hours they leak. But this product leaks after 2-3 hours. Want to return it
Not a good product I just order from Amazon I m unable to go for shop bcoz of my accident Amazon have to update products grades by its quality.
This product elastic is not good and leave stretch marks on babies skin. Not recommended.
I bought this by mistake. Usually i buy  normal pampers pants. this time i never noticed that they changed the model to Air. This wont even withstand for 3 hours. One of the worst product. I will never ever buy this!
Good
Pathetic quality... Earlier the quality was good now they are not interested in maintaining the quality.. I could have given negative rating if the option was given to me... Don't go for it you better go for snuggles which is of a better quality in good price..
Product quality is very good . Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate
Bad product no durability... Maha Ghatiyaa product.  Ghatiya seller ko remove kro. Paisa lo but acha product.
After trying a few diaper brands i can easily say it is by far the best one.its really comfy and soft for baby and majorly we dont need to change it before approx 6 to 7 hrs. Good absorption for a proper night sleep of a baby
Dear amazon.in
  This product quality is absolutely rubbish because every diapers very poorly quality and liackege. I'm very shocked for Amazon facility service. So please immediately rectify and provide best resolution.
Not work more than 2 hrs In night.
Need to review for all above products.
Kindly do the needful
This diaper leaks too often. Rest everything is fine. It is soft and absorbs well.
Nice product for my nephew. He really loves it.
"Very bear diapers, very skin friendly for my 1 year old"
Its easy to wear for travelling purpose . And got it for gud offer nice quality of the product is nice as in shown in the pic.Nice
Am a frequent buyer of this.
"This time the quality is worse ...leaking , thin a d not worth. Looks like duplicates are included by vendors as part of original stocks."
Otherwise we always prefer Pampers
This is the first time we are ordering this 64 pieces..we used to order 54 pieces..it was very good..but this one is in Very poor quality ..Its very thin..easily torn.. and some powdery dust is coming from some pieces...not worth it..
This is not for 9 to 14 KG child. Too small a size as per that age group. We have been using taped Pampers M size 6 to 11 KG and this time we ordered Pamper pants 9 to 14 KG and these are even smaller than the taped Pampers.
Amazon should provide good discounts on such product
Very useful and friendly product. Using pampers diapers from beginning.
"One of the bad product which i ever purchase. Daily its leak and urine came out, my daughter wakesup daily just beacuse of this. Waste product."
Very in comfort
"I prefer to trust the seller, final satisfaction of the customer depends upon the deals."
It's not at all good product... I am using diaper for my child from last 3 months and this I don't think is the original product...my child got rashes badly after using this.. otherwise he never faced this problem
"Using it for my 3 years old baby for few years. Great discount on mrp and price also less than big bazaar, so good purchase."
Normally pampers absorb and last for atleast 4-6 hours but recently what i got is not even worth for sepending money. I recommend not to buy this pamper pants diaper.
Worst it always leaks alwayssss doesnt expect it frm so called pampers...
Material is little bit hard
Pamper premium care is more comfortable
The products are no more of original quality and the diapers are thinker and doesn't hold longer like the original ones.. Don't buy these diapers.. it's just a sheer fraud by seller..
"Last time i ordered the same product,but that was very worst quality,very small in size.but now this time i was surprised to received quality product and material and size are good.i will expect all my purchases are this type."
This new pampers air doesnt have soakability . we are using pampers from18 months.. but this time every time there is leakage problem..the previous model was good.  there is little size issue as well...
Good product and is easy to use. Material quality could go better.
"Recently I brought this one as recommended by my frd, n I found it really very good."
Earlier i used mammy poko pants which used to get heavy and also used to leak.
I am happy with this product
"It's not expected from pampers, my 6 month old son got rashes after using, tried for 1 week and notice more rashes and stopped using it. Even more leakage within 4 hours. Totally disappointed with pampers diaper."
"Good product when compared to all other products in market, also it fits corect to my baby, very good absorbency at loght weight, also very precise in size and price, also no harmfull to baby skin due to high quality cotton"
Quality is good. Diapers are soft and comfortable for my baby. Good absorb capacity. Worth and value for money.
This product is very different from the one which I bought earlier. Not at all soft and size was also smaller compared to the earlier product.
"Dis satisfied with this product, The gel started to come out and spread around baby, The stitches also came off. Stay away. Also the absorbing gel is less compared to older diapers. Not sure why. Better choose alternative."
Not for my baby. Didn't absorb properly..i felt that the material was rough
Horrible.... I ordered for XL(112). I got  1 packet of XL and 1 L..
That too product is not returnable
I have been using pampers for my kids since long. They are super cosy making my kids sleep peacefully. Their good absorbing capability make my kids sleep for very long time.
Very thin quality and it's leaking  doesn't feel like that it is pampers brand.
In the pack mentioned medium size but the pants are not in same size it’s very small not come for long time. That same pack I will buy in local shop it is in correct size and comes for long time.How it’s happens
I think my baby is ok with this product except she something cause skin rashes but it is okay.
I give this product to my aunt.she has a small daughter.Its very comfrot..she loved it..
I am so happy with the pampers. My baby doesn't feel any burden while wearing pampers diaper  his skin is breathable and all thanks to its good quality he has never got rashes due to diaper. Highly recommended to all the parents from my side
Softer than those available in the shop and last longer. Comfortable good product and useful it will help me for my child
I found it of poor quality once again . It was leaking oposite of leak proof.. Not observing for more than 1hr..  this is duplicate product which is completely unacceptable.  I want this should be reported .
This is 100 percent fake product....getting filled soo fast and leaks...very bad....waste of money....don't buy this.....
Worst ever quality... Compare the quality with 24 rs local shpo pampers.. That local shop pampers good in quality.. Thickness is so low to compare with 24 rs pampers
"the product is good, but price is high comparing some brands"
I used pampers pant for my younger brother and found them very soft and soothing.They absorb all the liquid and don't let it to leak.Also it doesn't leaves rashes on skin. I must say It is Value for money......
it is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too.. Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit.
"It good and afcourse the oldest bran as far as I know , I m giving for stars cos premium are a little better than these but otherwise no issue"
Pampers is always I like for my baby's skin .... It is soft and non itchy to my baby's skin.... So I would like to recommend for others.....
These are perfect for little movers with chubby thighs! Regular diapers dug into my baby’s legs but these don’t and they work at least as well as Swaddlers. Would definitely buy these again.
The product was very good even after reading other negative reviews I still went ahead and bough the pack of 54 and got a discount of 200/+ was happy with what I purchased.
it is working fine.but doesn't give any indication that it has reached it optimum level of absorption. if there is any indication to that effect it will be great!!
Very comfortable to my baby. So easy to use. Easily last up-to 8 hour.
It was so comfortable to baby while sleeping especially in the night. No leakage problem. No odors to come.  Using the product since from 2 months onwards. No rashes. So new moms have to buy the product without doubtful.
Pampers is the best diapers for babies. It supports there delicate skin and keep them away from rashes and other infection. It keeps them dry and always happy. They dont feel irritated anymore and keeps mom happy as well
"The diapers start leaking after one hour of use and all the clothes worn by baby have to be changed, which causes a lot of trouble. It seems like a fake product which is not expected from Amazon and its vendor Cloudtail."
"I love pampers- they're comfortable, very absorbant and soft"
product is good but very stuffy after use also it leaks from side n between the legs
"Duplicate product, with very bad quality, i opened it after 15 days so could not able to return, is it really a pamper make. For sure pampers will loos customers.."
"Worst quality product, they use glue Which stick to babies and looks like a black spot and it's not durable, within 3/4 hours it has to be removed, really very disappointed with this prodt."
"This time i feel the product you delivered was fake because the quality of diaper is bad, doesn’t feel like original pamper product. Diaper get full very soon nd its starts leaking which is very uncomfortable."
it is leaking every time also not so comfortable. very tight. i will not suggest to use any one. i brought big pack 152 nos. there is no replacement policy for same now decided to give to my made servant baby.
perfect for kid and also comfortabe and no doubt its totally leak proof good to by for every kid
Pampers diaper is a good diaper that keeps my baby skin rashfree. He feels very comfortable in it  as it absorbs the wetness quickly. He sleeps for longer hours after wearing pampers as it is leak proof and vei soft.
"Good product, brought it for Rs 666 for 76nos medium size"
The diaper leakes in just 2hrs and the baby is all wet. Seems the product is duplicate. Can I check the authenticity of the product online?
Worst quality ever..i hav no words to explain about these daipers dat how bad these are...shame on u who hd snt these diapers..atleast u shud thing about childs they hv so much sensitive skin...just hate this product...
"Good for baby's skin ,no rashes"
leaking.. not meeting the basic needs..  dont buy pls
"First time we used, disgusted by the durability, start leaking after 4-5 hours during the night. Will never ever buy again. U might as well use other inferior brands, even they are better than these Air diapers. RUBBISH"
"There is no issue with the product. The main problem is placing of order. Earlier we have ordered for medium size, but we received the small size."
Very easy to use for my toddler as using from very beginnin.
It just wouldn't soak
" Everytime I put my hand in to check, it's entirely wet.. baby's whole bottom was wet always"
"We always use Pamper products for my kid..,  it was very soft and very much comfortable for kids."
"Way cheaper than other shopping sites, happy with the purchase. Ordering more"
Usually its watering out when bought in amazon than buying in local shops.
Yet to confirm abt this
"Half of the packet was fine but than rest diapers were filled very quickly and even thay leaked also with its Crystel gel, which spread all over my baby's body. Poor quality material I used in some of the diaper pants."
Diaper leaked within two hours and baby was wet for whole night kindly check the quality you send worst experience either I have got the fake product or pampers have a manufacturing fault worst experience headed so far
Really good in absorbency for whole night.. no leakage... Looks dry even after the whole nyt use..
This time very cheap quality...urine. Is coming out its mean it's cheap.
I am very loyal customer of Amazon. This time very disappointed
Great fitting and perfect for all situations
No leakage no raises
Soft and smooth
Great Pampers
It's care like mom.
Love you Pampers <3 !!
"I have always experienced whenever I have ordered monthly pack, there is always issue of leaking diapers."
We order monthly pack for our convenience but it is always cheated.
Ive taken subscription to your Pampers but this time the quality was very bad. My baby's pee and stool sometimes even comes out from sides. Not expected this from Pampers.
"Good diapers, No skin harshness after use, leak proof, softness, Good elasticity, but do not expect for 12 hours absorbency."
Contains soft materials and cream that keeps skin soft and clean. It is working out for our baby skin.
It's compaire with other brands too much cheap quality
Satisfactory result. But therr are other better products also available in other brands.
"Pampers M size MRP price 999,but I purchased price 648 only.. super deal.. good material..nice quality..I thank to Pampers & Amazon."
I have been using Pampers for my son since his birth but the latest order received defective piece. It's leaking and breaking also cannot last long for 12hrs as they promised.
Decided switch to a different brand.
Ever since I have started using diaper for my baby this product has been my choice .... pampers premium truly lives upto our expectations
Product is worth of money we spend.Buy pampers n and have no worries.it is leak proof and easy to use.its so soft that a baby forgets wearing it.its leak proof and absorbency is good compared to other company pampers.Thankyou pampers
The quality of the material is very good and light so its comfortable for the baby. Moreover it doesn't leak.
I ordered 2 pieces 1 piece was of good quality other packet wasnt good it had low absorption capacity . Wont trust quality pampers should maintain its brand value otherwise it may lose its regular customers
Got it for best deal RS.1176 (152 count) .. If I buy same in local I may spend more than that.
Have tried using pamper pants. There are easy and comfortable. Perfect for short outing. Effortless to change it outdoors. It would be great if they could be as long lasting as pamper active pants
"Since birth I have been using only pampers for my son who is a year old now. Very easy to use, keeps baby dry all night. I strongly recommend to all the new mothers out there."
"Is product ko hum dislike karte hn. Iski quality bahot hi ghatiya h.Aaplog discount deker ghatiya quality ka samaan bechte ho.please isko apna wapas leker mera amount back kar do immediately and call me.Don,t ignor it."
"This one is not the same which we are getting in shops , there is a difference in the material and it’s light weighted."
This product is a fake one which doesn’t lost for long period and it’s getting leaked too😡
"Very bad ,"
"Simply lost my money for buying monthly pack ,"
Other company diapers r good compared to pampers monthly pack.
So my dear friend don’t buy pampers
Hereafter. Buy amazon ‘s item it’s good
Excellent
I got subscription to this... but I started getting old stock of the product... which is almost 5 month old.
"Currently at the same price, there is an updated version of the product that is"
"Nice product. Pants model are better than normal diapers. Easy to wear, remove & use. Haven't tried to kid other than pampers brand. So cant compare."
"Good quality, long lasting, perfectly fit to my child. It is comfortable and the price is also comfortable. I am really glad to buy it ."
The quality of the diapers is worst...Fraud on the name of Pampers... baby get wet in 1 hour only.....
Totally loss of money..... I am cribing on spending
Pampers is my go to diaper as it is durable and leak proof. Love it for night time diapering and long travel
"This is the best diaper so far, i have used other diapers too but this one is actually having the best material quality and its also easy to use than others."
Product is good no doubt about it as it’s from pempers. Just that price is little higher as compare to few top super stores in market.
Best diapers in terms of quality... Causes no rashes or mon rashes.. Been ordering this every month from amazon.. coz most days they sell it at a 17% discount and on a lot of days at 20-25% discount..
Good quality product....but Amazon suddenly increase the price of this item almost 15% in comparison of last 15 days duration.
I think its good for babies who do not move much but for active baby it may leaked.
"Very easy to use, dry for long time my baby very comfortably sleep at night due to gud observe and no leakage"
Pamper pants quality is good. Soaking capacity is less than tape diapers though. Taje a size bigger for ease of use.
It good but sometimes it is leaking from side n front.
Some of the diapers was heavy and discoloured. Probably they were used or crossed the expiry mark...
"This Quality is very fine and you can compare with any brand, i have used its very use full and soft with no leakage"
Pampers pants is the best and comfortable for the kids
"Nice soft and comfortable for toddlers,Specially the active ones who are running around. Leakproof and hygenic."
"Very hard on baby skin, go for mamy poko pants."
"Pampers I received looks very poor quality, very thin compared to same pampers bought on store. I doubt if it is original pampers"
I have been using this brand since my child began to use. its perfect in size and fitting. you don't need to think so much at list for 12 hrs once you put new pant. Pampers are always good to use.
"I have used this product earlier, but this only looks like duplicate of the original product. The material quality is poor and it's very thin. I don't know wether pampers has compromised with quality or wether its a fake material."
As it's a product used daily. I like the monthly box saver offer. It's reasonable and good quality for babies.
Full stars for pampers...very comfortable.. must buy
"I received a poor quality product. Even though I have been ordering the same product for last four years, this is the first time i have received poor quality monthly mega box."
first is its big quantity pack... and on Amazon shop its purchase on more than 25% discount....
I recommended to everyone to purchase this type of product on Amazon shop...
First of all packaging was really nice. But the product quality was really low. It is not the same pampers diaper we got from stores. The plastic cover is so thin and leads to leakage.
"According to me,Pampers pants are best diaper pants for my baby.. i used various brands bt this is what i liked to use for her."
And delivered before mentioned delivery day everytime.. this service is.. ummaah.
This product is good for baby skin no rashes no leakage.  I am happy
Its 2 pack of 56 pc and pàcked in a compact cartoon.
Good for monthly
"Using since birth day of my baby, itz been 8 months....my baby faced no rashes till day. Must recommend Pampers 👍"
Good for babies. We use it only during travel and at night
material quality is fine
Durability is long time fitted to baby
Easy to use nice designe
Pampers pants have been like a friend since the birth of our child. We have trusted them than any other brand. They are so soft and comfortable for my child that he loves them too. Thank you pampers for such a good quality product.
It leaks when baby is not in laid down position. When i put my baby on lap it leaks through back.it doest absorb that good
Horrible product . It's almost 2 years I have been purchasing diapers from Amazon but have never come up with such an experience.  The product is defective and diapers are leaking also getting races .It is not original Pampers
Leak proof and very comfortable for baby.Very light weight. And soaks very much compared to other brands. Soft material. Easy to wear and easy to tear. Fulfill what it claims. 1 pampers = 1 dry and peaceful night.
"Pampers has been always my first choice since my son was born. The material quality is very good.  Its very soft on skin,  smells good,  easy to wear and remove too.  Diaper wearing has been super easy since then."
Always good for babies. But frequent use may create skin infection to babies.  Consult Doctor.
Looks like a fake product of the original.
There's enough doubt hence writing the review.
"Very comfortable for my kid. No leakage, Amazing absorbent for around 6 hrs..! No diper rashes after wearing it.. my baby feels comfortable after wearing it. And I can feel relaxed."
"The name pampers hv always been the best for diapers and this product has proved it so...the diapers are really good,durable,good absorption,has nice cartoon prints. !! Really good product ..."
Price is high when compared to my recent purchase of the same product.
"The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this"
"My 1 yr old kid is not comfortable in this. Also, water absorption capacity is somewhat less than mamy poko pants."
"very good diaper,supperb absorbing capacity,very soft,100% leak proof, just go for it...."
It's not that much good.it has leakage problem
Have been using pampers bought from amazon since a while now...no problem with the quality...hav used the same for my daughter n my son...quality hav been the same...never tried any other daiper for tat matter...
I had ordered for my baby . The material in the diaper absorbent is verry good even its looks good and fit to my baby
I think it's duplicated product because I wear this pamper then next morning he gets rashes...
Its not bad
But then the premium care one from pampers is better in all possible ways
Poor quality ...I'm a regular shopper with Amazon but this time the product I recieved was worst...it cannot hold for even 2 hours. Starts leaking ...shall think twice before I order again
"Very low quality diapers, not worth the cost. Would go for a different brand"
I have never expected this type of rubbish material from Amazon.
So disgusting for purchasing from the seller.
The quality of pampers is very bad and leaks after two hours.
Only 2 star may be given
"duplicate product delivered, its not same as last time XL  pants we bought, quality very bad and some odour also coming"
"Absorbing capacity, softness, leak proof than other current market brand."
High efficiency in low cost per piece and babby happy with this use of pamper for 10 to 12 hr per piece.
Nice for very less price comparatively market price
The duplicate product sells by Amazon. Not seen any number in diaper. The barcode number printed on original diaper's one side.  This product is duplicate. Please don't buy. 👎👎👎👎
Very comfortable and absorbs for 12 hour good night sleep.
"Item is not as per description, very very poor quality."
I have used pampers many times but this one is very thin and I am sure it is not pampers. It is just like tissue paper. There is no return option also.. First time I am.not happy with amazon.
"Overall good product by pampers,  main thing box despatched awesome and not damaged but it is a pricey product so I recommend This product to other"
"I loved this diaper pant , it went for the whole night - I mean for 12 hours, and I didn’t have to change in between . So the sleep was undisturbed and it was soft for my baby skin even in the morning."
Good product for children at an affordable price
"These pampers were absolute beauties,fit and quality wise. The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit. Pampers is super thin my baby could wear any dress over it frocks,pants,rombers anything."
Product is good. good material though the elastic cud be improved further since some of the diapers elasticity is not that good. but i guess nothing can be perfect. overall great product considering other brands
"If you have been using premium product earlier. Then, this product is not for you. I had different experience with quality and size."
"Very nice , price also low as compare to appolo pharmacy offer to us"
Value for money while purchasing through Amazon
"Not absorbing, always baby back was wet when opened."
"Not good for over night use.lasting 5 to 6 hours. Not more than that,after that it's leaking..so,not satisfied with the product.."
Material quality is very bad. Most of them in one package was leaking within 2 hours of wearing. Duration was less when compared to other packages. Is really unhappy with this now. The money spent was wasted.
Quality is not same as like outside.
Before I had purchased with other sellers which are very good and worth for the discount
"Dryness for whole night in 1 diaper. I used from 10 pm to 10 am, no need to change or check while sleep"
Pampers is always my favourite brand among all the diaper brand..quality is really soft..awesome absorbing power..and its very flexible to use as it come with pant style which is easy to put on..really happy with the purchase
Product is good if compares with Huggies and average if compares with Mummy poko pant
It is not leak proof... I’ve tried this product earlier.. n had bought it from a store ... had seen amazing results... but the ones I ordered on amazon are not leak proof... they are 100% not original
The elastic leaves marks on baby skin after long time of use. Worst product made of cheap elements
The package was good and got delivered early. The pants are soft and comfortable for my baby
I have been using pampers for my kids since last one year. Best part about them is that their absorbing power is lovely. They are very comfortable for my kids. My kids get very good sleep with them on.
"L size is lower quality compare to m size, after 3 hours leaking start, need improve quality"
High absorbency which keeps my baby dry all night and soft on baby skin .. after using for a long time it doesn't harm my babies skin. And very easy to use
Great....better than mamy poko pants that i used to use earlier
We used pampers in past and that where missed reading reviews before buying this. As some others have mentioned This new design is very poor quality. Diaper is too thin and leaks.
Trusted brand...
Material is good for kids skin...
Cheaper than local market...
Need to improve d quality which u were satisfying in ur previous materials.. Not getting that quality..
They are different from the regular pampers diapers I use. These are thin and quality is not good.
Product is soft but not upto mark.on level it mention one pant one night but its wrong.its  not  good as we required.quality need to be improved.i m not satisfied with product and i just feel i waste my money.
The quality of material can be further improved. Infact pampers premium pants are available with heavy price. Would appreciate if quality can be improved with same price.
Overall it's an good product but there is an issue with absorbency.
it is a nice product and value for money
"When it comes to diapers I trust only pampers. Got the diaper online this time, very happy with the purchase. I am not a huge fan of on line shopping but got the pampers diaper at a very good deal."
"The product is good, although I liked the premium version of the diapers more they were better in softness of the material. Overall good purchase"
It's very comfort for my baby.... No leakage in the product... overnight guarantee for leakage.... I like Pampers.. size only differ but it's ok.
"Hey , it's one of worst product. Quality of this Pampers pant worst. The quality what I purchased from retail shop is good. But this I purchased through online. Simply bad. Even I can't returned it."
New pampers seems like a strategy to promote premium packs as the quality has been compromised drastically and it started leaking after few mins irrespective of quantity of urine.
These have been bad. They r tearing while putting them on. Have to keep changing at night. The ones with the channels r much better
Using Pampers since birth of my baby. Tried other brand duapers also but Pampers suit best to my baby. Getting monthly pack at attractive price always on Amazon.
Pamper is really a good brand for Diaper. But Quality of this product does not seems good. Diaper is getting leaked after use of just 4-5 hours. Huggies is better than Pampers.
One of the worlds trusted and best brand.very Soft and good product
Soft and gentle but the material is thin compared to Himalayan diapers
This Pampers pants style diapers is easy to use and really liked the quality of the product.  The ease of the product makes it more simple and ready to use
Superb. Value for money. Very cholesterol price very good product. I m use this product for last 3 month.
This seems to be a fake product .the diaper start leaking within one hour and gets super heavy .the waist band tears off very easily while putting it on the child.There is definitely quality issue .
"This product doesn't deserve even  One star also . Worst product. Everytime it leaks. I want to return but Amazon doesn't allow this to return. Please don't buy . Amazon , u have to answer for this."
Quality of the material is really good. It doesn't leak and my baby is comfortable in Pampers always..
Every single diaper is leaking. Not sure whether this is actual product or fake one. This the 10th Diaper and all are leaking.
And they have no return policy. Be ware before purchasing.
FAKE PRODUCT
This is of a very poor quality.. Every single piece is getting leaked in just 30-40 mins after use.. Its such an inconvenience to change it every hour specially in winters.. Pls don’t send duplicate products.
The product is really too good.....When coming into diapers my first preference is Pampers....As it is very Soft and Comfortable to my baby.....
"Pampers is the a good product, and the discounts in Amazon are always irresistible"
Got on time and with quality.
However got two 64 packets inside the box.
"Everything is good, but having some smell"
Great product. Always my choice. My kids never had allergies with its use.
i like this diaper much. i am happy to use pampers for my son. it absorbs full and so soft. no more leakage... i loves it more.. my son always feel good when i wear this..sooo good.. i recommend to all moms..
Found Pampers is dry and less bulky than mommy poko pants
They stay longer and are really dry
This is a fake product. Zero absorption. Huge waste of money.
There is no return on this product as well.
Worst Pampers product ever bought. Feels heavy and wet after 2hours of use. Even leaks. Very thin to hold pees. Used medium 80 pack and that was not giving any problems and used to remain dry for whole night
duplicate provided...No serial no on pampers....worst quality ..nothing inside only cotton.....Noticed late...due to lack of knoledge..even for prime members ...u are not providing good products...
"The pamper gets torn very easily and gel from inside is coming out. Very very bad quality. Might be second or third range quality or QC failed products,that's why they are selling in high discount."
its really comfortable and easy to use and get it on the website
"Extremely bad product purchased at primium Price, the whole purpose of diaper is dialiute with this product, if we have to change the diaper after every 2 hours than we prefer Cotton nappies instead of Diper"
Amazing leak proof diaper pants for babies.  I have bought these for my baby since her birth.  Super absorbant and leak proof.  Soft materials with  aloe vera so baby doesnt get any rashes.  Highly recommend
I have been using pampers since a year for my baby..its quality is so good..stay last longer for a night experiencing the quality better than huggies diapers..light weight...air flow is also good..
Great product to take away the worries of frequent changing of clothe diapers.
"I liked the product because it's better then the earlier one, it's leak proof with super softness for the kid for goodnight sleep with out wetness. It's absorption quality is better compared to other diapers"
Not soft on skin of baby. Putting hard impressions on the skin in small time. I think this particular order was not of good quality or may be duplicate
Ok product. It can't take more than 2 piss by my son.
"Very Good Product, Fitting is very good and comfortable for my 5 months child with good absorbency."
"Best diaper, I have tried my boy all other brands diaper but I didn't see better comfort for baby on other brands, I truly suggest Pampers diapers, you will not regrets"
This new air channel diapers are worst elastic is not as good as easy absorp one.smells fast
I don't know but the diapers which I bought from here seems to have very low absorbing capacity. It got leaked in low discharge as well. It has happened first time with pampers.
Nice product...i am certifing for purchase this product  as I ve been using since last two months  for my child.
Looks like a duplicate product. Leaks all the time for my baby though she is only 8kgs.
Total waste product don't buy
"Pampers are best my son is 2 yr old from his birth to till now we only used pamper its soft and leak proof also, does not causes any rashes yet"
Bought the pack of 76. Most of them are below par the quality. After use of 2 hours we see the leakage. Been using this from past many year's.. firts time experience this kind of issue with a premium brand.
"It is the best diaper in terms of its absorbency, leak proofness , softness and oberall price effectiveness. Pamper is the one stop solution for guranteed sound sleep of your baby. Just go for it."
Didn't expect this kind of product from Pampers.
Looking for more rofits I guess. Quality has reduced drastically for the air pokets version. Not good for more than couple of hours.
Full comfort ..
Easy to use .....
Nice product ....
Use all over night .....
"Absolutely fantastic product from pampers. Got it for my baby and I am very much impressed with absorbency, leak proof as well as the softness, the lovely smell of aloe vera makes it a fine quality product."
Not happy at all. Been using pampers brand of diapers and pull up for 3years and purchased this thinking it would of the same quality as the one in the US. But thoroughly disappointed. Would not repurchase.
it is not good....it cant hold my baby pee for 1 hour....having leakage problem....need to change diaper for every 1 hour
Worst product ever...I have used for my baby and it's leaking with 1st urine..how can it last for night.. It's fake product or it's defective product...All the pieces in pack is leaking.
It is totally amazing...leak proof and my child never got any rashes
Very nice products  Quality better than me other products ok so nice to have a great time at the same
It seems product is not genuine. My baby is 17 months old am using L size diaper but its totally wet after a single pee.
"Amazon must do quality, genuinity check for its reputation."
"By using this diaper pants ,create some itchiness to my baby. The quality also not good."
Pampers leak proof and very soft good product price is very likely..
Have been using pamper diapers for my baby since baby was newborn. But this time the diaper quality seems to be different and degraded. Won't ever buy these diapers from Amazon
I always trust pampers pants for my children.
These are always comfortable for my child and rate is also genuine ..
Overall awesone products
This is awesome product and good paking
I am very happy to buy this product
Trusted brand. My baby had been using Pampers since very first day. We recently switched to pant style and this is great! Fits well and keeps baby comfortable and dry.
NW a days pampers are not leak proof. Worst exp I have with this
Never purchase this product. The diaper will first swell after getting wet and then start leaking within 4-5 hrs.
I am using  pamper for my baby since day one. ..they have the brst quality diapers available in the market...extremely light breathable and cottom like soft..olso  leak proof.. Pampers diapers is the best.
"Form the day 1, we are using Pampers baby diaper pants, use only after applying coconut oil on baby. But Yeah something it also possible that Diaper could leak. So always keep checking. Be Happy Parenting."
Nice product :)
"I had given 800 rupees to delivery boy and product price was 776 rupees but he not return to me 4 rupees, says i have no change. Every time delivery boy give this kind of excuse."
"Very bad quality not more absorbing than other products baby is comfortable ,bad absorbency, leakage and soft like low quality"
Pampers are best when it comes to diapers. Amazon provided these at about half the price of MRP with subscribe and save.
Never thought that Paper's have such low quality product. It's very thin. It not lasting for minimum 1 hr. It's my genuine suggestion don't buy it go for Huggies.
Paid more to buy this one but its very good to use.
quality is not so good ..u can use pure cotton
These are diaper pants without strap lock.
Just like mummy poko pants .
These pants has less absobation capacity as compared to strapped diapers of Pampers.
"100%satisfied, its mrp is 999, amazon delivered me @just 636😍😍😍"
Soft on skin and leak proof product..
Pampers are very soft and very good absorbent. These are best as compared to other baby diapers. No rashes no leakage and very useful when you are traveling. I recommend to use it for your baby.
Yeah it is good..
Wait for the offer
Best quality easy absorbent skin friendly comfortable to child
"Pampers baby-dry pants style diapers are the providing your baby a new type of dryness overnight, breathable dryness improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s good absorbtion"
My kid is almost 1.5 years old and I have been using pampers since day one. I must say this is the best baby diaper in terms of absorbency and quality.It lasts all night without any leakage.. go for it!!!
This Pamper is very good for babies. It's really very soft diaper. And And And it's 100% Leak proof too. must Buy it from Amazon.
You can use this in need. Regular use must avoid.
"At first look i thought amazon delivering fame products, but then i had to give a try. To my surprise, Pants are working fine."
"Very good product,it's easy to use and very comfortable for my child."
"World's Best Diapers For Baby ! No Leakage , No Itching ... And Easy To Use !"
I Recommend All Mother's To Use It . It's Easy To Use And No Harm For Baby
Amazing brand! Been using from the beginning for my baby and wud never change!
"Don't go for it. Half of the huggies are waste they are durable for just 4,5 hours only"
Package was torn. 3pc were taken out
thanks for the seller.. my kid love this....
No issue while use every day use. No bed effect to baby.
Same as to buy as local shop.
"Manufacturer date is only 1 month old, so product is good."
Sufgest to buy.
It's very soft... I have been using Pampers since years...it's very comfortable for my baby
Best leakage proof pants for my baby . Very soft very comfortable . And worth of money
Product quality is very good . Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate.so I suggest always buy from Amazon for cheap and genuine product.
I have used so many others brand for my baby boy .but it is the best one
"I have been using pampera for my baby since 2 yrs, however the product delivered this time is sure fake. The packet says L size but its smaller. It doesnt abosrb more than 2-3 pees done by my kid."
Diaper is very poor in softness. It gives marks all around. Very bad quality
Plz plz plz don't waste your money on this product. Built quality is very very very poor. I think packing is original but material inside is rejected or of bad quality. Once again don't buy it.
It won't last long u need to change it in every 4 hours... It will leak
Quality is very bad compare to the old model. Air channel model is leaking many times. There has never been a leakage problem with the old one. Anyway bought Mammy Poko after this issue.
I use pampers baby dry pants from the day my baby was born
Its rashfree and comfortable for the baby
Leak proof and easy to use
Happy with the quality 👍
Will highly recommend pampers
This is pathetic product  I have ever seen. There is son much leakage not even give durability of 6 hrs forget about 1 dry night. On regular basis my daughter got wet due to so much leakage within 6 hrs.
Product is good.i used this for my 5 months baby.and the product delivery very speed.i ordered this is free delivery it say take 3 to 4 days.But i received in next day of ordered.packing also good.
"Very very nice,very comfortable for my child"
I've been using Pampers since the day my son was born and it's been 25 months now.iv tried other diapers also like mammy poko pants Huggies but the material and durability of Pampers is unmatchable
Thanku pampers
"Great product, completely satisfied with this however they could make this cheaper. Huggies is a waste of money."
Actually it does not last for more than 5 hours. I think the older one was better.
Pampers Pants are always my first choice for my baby. They are super absorbing and the softest diapers ever. Highly recommended.
Didn't expected this from pampers although the diaper pant is very light weight it didn't last for long only two hours more than that it leaks.....
Its not worth the price...
It dont last long..too thin and does leakage every time my baby wears it... too bad quality
Its definitely not the original one
First time i bought diapers online.
I bought this for my daughter's.
These Diapers are  very soft. And leak proof till good time average.
I will buy it again.
"The worst ever product from pampers, donno whether its original or duplicate but jus worst of its kind, don’t recommend thuan kind of diapers for infants, I don’t even give those single stars."
"This pack is very worsted, absorbency and leak proofness is very bad. I am giving it zero 🌟. I am very sad that Pampers is delivered this type of product. don't give discount but keep quality maintain."
tried almost every brand for my little angle but none of that match the quality of this products. the aggressive price the main factor it is the best selling diapers. thank you pampers thank yoy amazon.
"using it from last tow days, not seen any problem yet. not even rashes."
i have used many other types of diapers for my baby after using pampers now after trying many other companies i came back to pampers very comfortable since from 2 years and 3 months.
I m using pampers for my daughter from the very beginning and she never had any problem...infact I like the air channels variant better than extra absorb and amazon delivery is best.
"for past two years i am buying pampers for my baby was very happy but this pack gave me nightmare experience. these nappies get filled faster and at times they leaked from sides.  one night we had to replace it thrice :( suggest other to consider it wisely).. i am forced to try other brands. They are very thin not sufficient for nights, and starts leaking. Worst experience in 2 yrs"
Should not be scented . Other wise good product
"Pampers pants are very good, I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby. Material quality is excellent"
I liked mammy poko better than pampers. This is leaking for my baby.
I think quality have come down on pampers
This is maximum i can give to this product..low quality daipers..i dont what was this..but there was lot of difference in size n quality
The product quality is very bad compared to Pampers bought from shops
Very nice product . I have been using this right from the first day for my newborn. It stay overnight and keep my child dry.
Not at all doing g it's function.... Always leaking...Suffered a lot with this product..But when we used it earlier it was pretty fine....May b duplicate this time
"just good then orders, not perfect"
Worst quality product. Starts breakig inside within half an hour. And every single diaper has a leakage.
good but not as good as momy poko pants
"Product quality is very poor, very thin and leakage issue within 3-4 hour. My baby is only 1  year and immediate leakage leads to unsatisssfaction. Suggest not to buy it. I want my money back"
I always prefer to use diapers from Pampers for my toddler.. they are very soft and leak proof.. Will surely recommend it to others
Its quality is too bad. It doesn't observed the urin. This is too much thin. Previously I was purchase one of this packet thats quality was good. But this product is useless. It doesn't work properly. This is worst of money.
Overall very good product.... But sometimes xl is with good fitting.... Nd at sometimes its small.....size s differing .... Other than that everything s good .....
"Good, This brand is the only diapers which suit my son. Worth the money."
Nice product am using small pampers diapers for my 8 month old baby and its not leaking quality is all good👍
Best product in the market and supplied by Amazon. Loved it.
Awesome product for my baby sleeping without problem all night with hygienic comfortable. Thanks Pampers.
I like quality. It is leak proof with softness. Good absorbent product use for long hours.
Good product. Use often when go outside.
This diaper is thin that most other diapers but has extra absorption capacity which makes my kid have an undisturbed night's sleep
lite and thin is the best part of it.
Either the diapers supplied to us were duplicate or Pampers has degraded the quality itself as the diapers are not able to last for more than 2-3 hrs before they start leaking. Complete waste of money
Product is good. It actually costs almost Rs.12 per unit in shops. We can get just more than Rs.8 per unit..which is great..
It is seeming fake.
getting filled too fast. material is almost like paper.
waistband is not full..weird band. I want to return the pack. please reply..
"It is a great product, material is so soft and comfortable, I didn't feel any rashes issue for my baby , It keeps dryness away for 10 -12 hours , I'll suggest parents to buy this product for your baby"
Very very good product pura pesa vasool he or baccho ke liye bhi bilkul aram dayak he
No leak very soft and dry
Cheap and worst product. It's leaking within an hour. Embarrassing too. This was not expected from Amazon. Selling fake products.. I have never complained in any of my previous order. Does not deserve a single star.
"Thanq Pampers,for making our Baby a blissful nights.."
Leak Proof is the highlight of the product which makes it a value worth product...
"No Rashes,and the softness it provides is awesome...."
I useing pamper from last 3 yrs for my kids . this product looks not genuine pamper plz take need ful to verify and replace my remaining......very very bad this is may be copied product .
Worth to buy. It is worth for daily usage.  Cost also s very discounted.
Far better than available daipers.
Pampers are good for small babby.it protects the skin of little babbyand the product is to soft so it dosen't harm babby skin .its an adorable product .i love the Pampers for my baby
Pant style diapers very soft with no wetness specially for a baby who is 24/7 in diapers.  Cost effective.
I have purchase outside places like mall and other shop then quality is very well but I purchase for Amazon but quality is not well. Please check quality and conform me. Thank you.
Material quality is good .. my baby is happy all the day !!! Active n cheerful 😁
This seems to be duplicate of pamper. First time worst experience
Not up to the standard of pampers.feel like duplicate product.last for only few hours.leaked everynigh.
"Intially its good, but past six months the quality is missing and the water is not holding inside instead its leaking out. Pls recheck the quality once what is promising."
There is no question of dislike!!Really good product!! Since I was a employee of this esteemed organization of P&G!!
Worst diaper very allergic to the baby
When  use caused heavy red rashes
"Bought 38 count medium diaper pants, just used 2 count. Highly allergic, doubt to be fake product, don't waste money"
Great product and Amazon gives discounts you really want to avail. Must buy for babies...have been doing it for the past 21 months for my child and no complaints
I ordered 2 Package of XL but I got 1 of the product as Large. Quiet disappointing
Using pampers for both my kids aged 2.3 yrdand 9 months since birth.Pampers as a brand has lived up to my expectations. .
Only brand name and high price but not so good like others.in some found leakages. Quality is poor.
"I love this product, I’m using it from birth of my baby till now he’s 13 months old now. My baby is comfortable with the product and no worries in the night. Thank you pampers."
"Worst ever purchase....leaves residue, quality is very  poor, did not even last for 3 hours.....do not recommend to infants because of rashes issues...."
"Nice product , affordable cost , quick delivery . baby was happy when wore."
This product is fake... diaper is leaking n small in size too plz dnt buy dis one. Very disappointed dis time
"Air dry is leaking , compared to previous model"
Looks like old stock one.
Doesn't able to hold even 1 pee.
Very nice product. No rashes. Soft and baby also likes it.must buy it.👍👍
"Very very bad quality , disappointed by this product . There’s leakage after 2-3 hours . Please do not buy this product total waste of money . Aware your relatives n friends about this bad product ."
"quality of the product is somehow less compare to the same item we bought from retail market. For example,the padded absorbent thikness is remarkably less comapare to same item from retail market."
This time i receive different product which is thinner then the original product
Very easy to put on and absorbs well.
I like the pampers diapers most..........
These are comfortable to my baby girl....
My baby feels so relax in these pants.....
Thnku Amazon....
"It’s super soft and protective ,leak proof absolutely comfortable for the child with a wet free good night sleep."
"Best product to buy, I m using this Pamper diapers for my daughter from last 2 years, Best product to buy. No leakage, no rashes, no pain. Keep you child happy & smiling"
"I have been using only Pampers for my Baby as they are of the Best quality. Feels so soft, Doesn't create any kind of Rashes and also Absorption is really good."
"The product delivered was fake.  I have been buying this product from almost a year, but never had any problem. But this package seemed to be fake.  The diaper wouldnt last for even an hour."
I used various products for my baby but Pampers meet my expectations.  It's good.
I am happy with the product. Easy to use & good quality. Anyone can use it easily being a father.
Best Part of Diaper is Softness .
This is low capability camparitivly other companies
"Poor quality.....absorb less ,,,in 10 dypers 1 will leak without uses....its good for short time upto 4 hrs ...go for Mamypoko pants for good quality ."
This new pack is really too inferior. Very thin and not observing...Need to use 10 peace diapers where using 4. Quality is really bad....
Perfect for baby and Perfect BRand to use this product.
Quality is of Pampers Is Going Down Year By Year Being Using this Brands from Past 3.8 Years Every Month I Order for My Son ....Trust Me Really Loosing the Quality ....Was a Bets Earlier Now We See the Choice
Really 1st I am unsatisfied about Amazon couirer. Material fully waste. It's giving duplicate material. Really sheller is so waste.
I observed leakage is happend .earlier I used mamypokopants I don't have any leakage in that.but diapers are very fresh and soft
"hope a better price than this,as there are more competative prices available"
"They were leaking most of the time, I have purchased 84 packed diaper small size but 70 percentage of diaper were leaked. I am very dispointed for its quality."
Pampers baby diapers are the best diapers for the child. It's fine absorbency helps to make the child more dry and comfortable.
Good product but some times leaks at nights
"The quality material was very bad, it causes rashes, and it remain only for 2 to 3 hours, not appropriate to use, duplicate as compared to original pamper........ Worst product leak proof"
I am using pamper for my baby since one year and it's really good.
"Material quality is ok, durability ok ok,"
Very poor quality.. Am changing the diapers in 2 hrs ones.. Its overflew. This is the first time by me this diaper's quality is poor. Pls give the quality one. Diapers is for babies pls keep in tat mind.
So good product. Value for money in this price.
They are not original ones. My baby kept on crying when ever i put the pamper received from this vendor. Please dont buy if you want your baby safe...
Love it.. can be priced lower for mega pack
I think this is duplicate product because thickness of diaper is very thin. All baby waste is out from diaper. Pl dont use this product.
"They are smaller, do not last long. Used Pampers before but didn't have such issue. Now stopped using this brand... much inconvenient if it doesn't last full night sleep"
Pampers Xl is small like large size compared to pampers premium care xl which is really extra large
Very soft and good protection.
I used pampers for my baby for 2 years but now suddenly the quality of diapers has declined.. The last 2 packs that i received in my subscription were not good..diapers leaked every night.
"Awesome.I use new Pampers for my son.. no rashes problem, safe to baby skin. No leakage problem. He sleeps all night without any disturbance. While traveling also no issues."
Pampers making wonderful diapers order for my baby nice product
Absorbency: Absorbs easily and easy to weigh
Leak Proof: There is no leakage in diaper
Softness: Soft to skin
It's very easy and helpful to kids with light weight.
"First of all thanks to Amezon for  within 2 days delievry. It is so soft and comfort for use. It observed too much ""susu"" and keep my baby dry too long. Go for it"
Best one I have used for my baby
"Absorbency, leak proof, softness, no rashes"
And monthly box is affordable n thank you Amazon for 30%off also  best one I ahve ever used for my baby
Worst quality when compared to single pack pampers.
There could be duplicate product which are sold in bulk.
I will be raising a complaint in consumer court regarding the same.
The product is very good and comfortable for the baby. My baby doesn’t feel irritated or discomfort with good smell. This also last longer than various other diapers.
"Wish I could give 0 or negative star. Small in size, not comfortable at all."
Kids are very comfortable... It is skin friendly.. I use it for my 1 year son.. It does not leak even after 12hours...i can say this is the best product in the market.
I bought same pack of pampers from medical and baby didn't get any rash where as the pampers I received through Amazon were of poor quality and baby got very bad rash.
Nice but needs to improve the quality of softness
Always calculate per piece price and remember it so it will help you to choose between online and shop.
Both give very good discounts. Choose wisely
The seller should be blocked.. how can it sell so cheap products for kids..shame
"If think Diapers ,think only Pampers"
Every thing are very good in this product
Good brand and value for money
I had ordered pamper diaper for my little one bt it is fake nails duplicate material. Dnt know why they r cheating us... At least care for little baby n deliver genuine product
if you want a feathery soft care for your baby than look no further. these pants are best it's better than others
"Has been using this ~3yrs, no worries"
plzz dont buy its worst product too much leakage & its like paper waste of money i've opened 1 pack i m fedup of this & i wanna return the other pack
Used it for both my kids
Good product
Its good and value for money.
I use pampers regularly.. but this lot was so bad ... my baby pees once and the diaper is full .. the feel of the diaper is also not like the original ..its horrible and definitely fake
Don't buy pampers brand. Go for some other brand. Waste of money. We don't expect from this brand. You have to check baby diper in night as it need to replace even after one time su-su.
Have been very happy with pampers earlier but this one was way too lacking in quality. Size smaller than normal. Absorbing capacity pathetic. Leaks to soon. Uncomfortable for the child.
Very useful diaper pants for babies that stays relatively fresh for longer periods
Very bad daiper full rashes my babys body
"I'm the biggest fan of Pampers. So many months of using it, and it has never leaked once. Nor has my daughter had any rashes. Would totally recommend this brand."
This is original pack of pampers diapers or not material is cheap quality and also size is not fair ( M) size not correctly please send me genuine products of daipers
Nice material quality. Looks durable and its easy to use too..
Pampers as a trusted brand perform as per the expectations the delivery was quick with neat packing
Good but many pieces look different in shape or may be little defective.
best product with leak proof and u can use upto one day for child ..awesome product go for it
"Very good product but still little hard for babies, add more softness to the item. Rest it is superb, thanks amazon for your service its too good 👌"
This one is the worst diaper packs I have received since using subscribe option. They didn't last for more than 6 hrs and the inner fabric from napkin comes out when we check in the morning.
This was a complete cheating ..nowhere it was mentioned that these pants will be prestitched and doesn't give you the freedom to put it on to baby and worst  is while removing and changing it ..
My baby feels comfortable by using the pampers.
I order large size but what I received it's really very small size but they are mension it's LARGE. I order lots of but it's never happened I am really very upset and its wast of money
"3rd class product,please don't buy anyone.The diaper durability is hardly for 2 hour however my baby is about to six month old and still diaper leaked in 2 hour.Material is also worst."
"In the night I should change 2times,rest all good"
It's okay but not good as Huggies.
Wonderful diapers. Provides comfort to baby.
Excellent quality product. Absorbing is very good. My son do not get any rashes after using these diaper. It's much comfortable for my son. Go with Pampers.
"Leak Proof, Good absorption capacity, Can last for 10 hours."
I've been buying pampers large size diaper since long every time I was satisfied bt this time I m disappointed bcz I've got the fake diaper
I received d pack wid mixed sizes. .  I bought M size.. But it consist of all S size mixed with it. .. 50%....So m not happy with pampers....
I like this so much & very comfortable
Excellent product. Super fast delivery
This product is awsm .. if anyone is first costumer of dis product or iske bare m kuch nhi janta phr bhi use aankhen bnd krke is product ko lena chahiye ...baby product h isliye no compromise..
"Worst pamper quality is very bad and get leak in 4,5hours very thin pamper look like paper quality i want to return the pamper.before it was good quality and now the worst i dont like it at all"
Good product from Pampers. Seller shipped very fast
Its very nice product. Material quality is superb. Price is also low compare to market price. Packing are also super..i like it
Pampers is always my first choice bcoz very soft material ..  no rashes.. long lasting .. easy to remove after use.. no leakage
"They making money only. They did not consider small kid. My kid legs fully rashes,"
Quality is not good
Really gud i m purchasing this item when my child birth .gud product go for it.
"Superb quality 👌 very comfortable . It doesn't loose after getting wet. It is itches free. Holds urine for long night , without any problem and does not wet cloths."
Pampers pants which we got from Amazon ws really pathetic its nt even durable for 2-3 hr. Baby is getting rashes due to leakage. quality of the diaper is very poor. It's a baby product kindly think over it.
Very nice n comfotable diapers For my baby feelings gud comfortable sleep.
My baby is very conform with pampers I won't change this products nice and gud feel for baby
Easy as lazy to go out get it. ..😆😆😆😆
This time  I will rev worst Pampers 4 hrs only then leakages.  Very very west for Pampers
Everything is ok . Best quality for Baby’s
Amazing and very good quality Pamperes for baby its one of the best quality Pamperes in the market quality is top notch and very light weight and Very comfortable for babies
"They might be expensive lot of all. But undoubtedly they are the best. No one can beat P&G products, I am their ardent fan."
"Very good product. No issues for babies. No leakage, correct fit.  Recommend to all users over Huggies."
Pamper is best
Everything gets dirty when you remove it.
"I AM KINDLY REQUESTING U ALL ,PLS DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ,BCS IF A TWO YEARS KID WILL PASS URINE TWO TIMES IT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND NEED TO USE MINIMUM 10 DIAPERS PER DAY.PLS DONT WASTE UR MONEY."
I don't recommend dis at all compared with mamypokopants snuggles huggies himalaya in all of dis pampers only d worst diapers for my baby.
Mei  review  padh  kar  sab  ke kafi  confuse  ho  gyi  thi  ki  mere  pass  real  aayeaga  ya  fake. But  thank God aisha  kuch  nahi  h.. it's real.
Itne profit  mei  kahi  nahi  milta.
"This is very low quality pampers,  very thin and less absorption capacity. We used 2-3pampers kindly come and collect the rest"
"Dry layer is very effective, easy to wear and economical"
"Even though price is high, product is good."
My kid is happy. He Never say no to dipers. N i get it cheaper than market.
"The previous Pampers M sized were amazing, absorbtion was good , sturdy and skin friendly."
"But, the new ones are low quality, absobtion is very poor."
"Hello, i started pampers when my babys size is ""nb-s"" , now her size is ""l"", i have not changed pampers because it is leak proof and its absorbency & softness are not given by any other diapers"
I used to order this regularly but this time quality is very bad. Diaper is getting leaked in every 2 hrs or so. This quality is not expected from Amazon.
Its very bad product if i campare it from another one Which is actually cheap at its price than also this product is very bad . Lets campare in the photo.
Haven’t had any issues with the product yet
When i opened the pack.it looked duplicate.. but checked online and found that its very light. Used it for my son for 2 months and none of them had any issues. Good product
Loving pampers pant from day 1 for my baby’s. There is no looking back. It amazingly covers baby body so that bo mess will be thr !
"I hope this is duplicate product, it is very bad quality. Do not buy this product. Leakage is happening. Instead of this you buy 1pack, 8 pack which is available near shop."
This time diapers which i have ordered has less capacity of absorption.. lickage is there... Each diaper has some kind of defect.. may b it has kept for longer time in stock.. less durability
These new pampers with ‘Air Channels’ are waste...leaking after one or two pees in 4-5 hours...useless...returning
Good product in this price
The quality of this pack what I have received is not that uptown the mark. It has leakage issue and the pant is soft material easily getting torn.
I am not happy with this pack
I've been using pampers for my baby since day 1 as pampers are easy to use and softest for babiy's delicate skin. Quality of material is also good. I'm a highly satisfied customer..
Again I received duplicate pamper from seller. Very poor quality leakage observed in only 3 hours. Again bad experience from Amazon for purchasing baby diaper  I want my money back.
"Product was very low quality, thermocol type material was coming out from pampers even with short duration, baby product should be good in quality, but it is not good, disappointed with this"
This is very bad quality diapers I have listened that Pampers is best diapers in all but my experience is very bad.it leaks in 5 to 6 hours only.
older pampers is better than new version.
Conpare to other diapers its very good. My son not getting skin rash after start using it.
Quality of the material is very bad.Only after 2-3 hours it leaks.i think it is old stock material.
"Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was of very good quality, but this new pack with""AIR CHANNEL"" is of wrost quality and leaking in every use. Not recommended, Pampers should revert to their older version."
"It absorbs heavy flow, works upto 7 hours in heavy flow,., The price should be less so that every middle class Mom can purchase so that she can do both baby care and house chores..."
I’ll always recommend pampers for all babies
Too good. Too Absorbent. Gvs 8 hrs of happy sleeping for my baby. Very soft as compare 2 other brands. A must buy Product.
Sorry to tell u that the product which u 've sold me is really worst these pampers dosent even last for 2hrs am really depressed abt this product what I 've bought here in online store .....
Good . Better than other popular brands
Doesn't seem to be original.. Size is way smaller than the ones I was using previously.. Totally disappointed.. Would never buy it again
Last 6 months am using this pampers for ma baby.am so glad to say..she is so comfort with these pampers.whole night its easy to use..and upto these days no diaper rashes ..soft material
"Very easy to use , nice product for baby and best price less than market price .....!"
"Pampers dry pants have been always comfortable for my baby specifically during these cold nights. It keeps him dry, so he can sleep peacefully. The quality is also really good compared with other products."
Leaking. More than 15% diapers in the pack was leaking. Will never recommend pampers to anyone.
Very poor quality. I think its fake product. Don't buy this.
"I am using it for my son at night time. Good one. If you properly change the diapers, it won't give rashes."
Nice but inconsistent . Below expectations. Had better experience in the past using pampers.
Very poor stuff it’s leaking can’t use at least a hour waste of money pls guys it’s not genuine
worth buying it during offer time.
Third class daiper..I just ordered it for trail..but mammy poko is better den dis..
It was always my first choice perfect for my baby soft skin
Good product but sometime leak..
The diapers are leaking during night.
"The Pampers quality seems low, prone to easy breakage and it gets full very quickly."
"I hv used this product before, as only Pampers suited my child well.  but this time it is leaking,  after some time, not all diapers,  but mostly. It seems a mixed bunch."
Very good absorption... Happy..
Best Quality Diapers that perfectly fits.
"Pampers matrial quality has dratically came down. They should undrstand , customers had choseen them for their best quality that they maintained till 5 months before"
"I have use diapers from other brands like huggies,himalaya ,mamy poko pant but pampers pants are best."
"Pros-no leakage problem,last more than 6 hours,easy to use,no diaper rash problem"
Worst duplicate product. I believed Pampers and was buying 80 PC's pack. This time it was not available and ordered 76pcs pack and received duplicate one. Doesn't last for a night
I am using this pampers before 5 month. It is too good and soft for my 5 month daughter from her birthday to till now.
Nice product and very comfort for baby
"Awesome product.,with leak proof and softness and the absorbency is very good throughout the night.the smell of diapers are good. Baby sleeps well in this diapers.Happy to use this product."
"Pampers product is not good at all, it is not able to keep dry for night..which earlier other Huggies and Himalaya Diaper are did..."
This product not eligible to return on Amazon
Daipers are leaking easily.
Good absorption definitely
"The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on skin.Material is alsi soft so no rashes.It doesn’t leak at all."
Below quality product. Everytime the diaper leaks and babies are getting nasty rashes whenever it is used. Doesn't seem to be original product
Very good product worth to buy absolute value for the money
Seems seller provided duplicate product. The daiper is getting torn after wearing for 1-2hours
When you use several product you certainly agree pampers are the best.
"Pampers is best. Tried many other baby care pads, but all others are good only in ads. Good quality and best absorption."
"Very good product, as described . My kid feels comfort in wearing during travel and night.. there is no overflow or irritation."
"I have tried all diapers and finally satisfied with pampers for my 5 months baby. Leak free, rash free with good absorption.. recommend all new mom's to use this."
Good discount but the product is a little disappointing
My baby is happy it is long lasting till 8 hours
Good quality product
It help to sleep baby well .
And size was fit to baby and very soft
Pampers diaper pants are beneficial for kids with heavy wetting and leaking issues.Material is non allergic and hygienic for small babies.Will recommend these to others.
I think it’s duplicates diapers..
"Awesome pants!! By child loved them. Completely leak proof, very soft on skin and have a very good absorbency."
Must use product for children
Keep baby dry for 6 to 8 hours. Easy to use and comfortable. Cheaper than open market.
Nice product. Easy to use and good quality.
"Love to use it while going out on short trips. Since my baby is a heavy wetter, i change the diaper mid night. Thin, light weight, easy to carry during travel."
This is the best I feel in all and I feel cloud products are original
"Good for children under 2 years. Quality of this diapers is very good. After getting wet, it doesn't become too much heavy. The children don't feel irritated."
My kid was happy with it
I always choose pampers for my kids safe and durable.
It's a soft n thin diaper unlike other diapers.but the bad part is I can't make my baby wear this diaper longer than 2-3 hours.. Coz it leaks out soon..
Easy to use. And extremely cheap when you buy in bulk.
Not bad.. Not good in terms of durability. Its soft as compaired to other diaper
"I have always been using Pampers but the last time I ordered the pack with Aloe Vera gel , the diapers are leaking. It doesn't give long hour dryness. It leaks badly."
"One of pathetic products I received, not good for the kids, uncomfortable, lower capacity."
"Nice product for pampers,it will great price but discount price is over🤨😑"
This product is very good for  childrens especially in night time
"Nice item for my 3 yr old son, light weight but good absorption"
Good product but its date of expiry should be clearly written at the time of purchase.
"This is the worst product.  They have provided numbers and discounts.  But, it has very poor quality,  very poor absorbency, and very poor softness.  It's better to other quality diaper pants."
Good purchase go for it
Leakage issue. Inner layer is very thik.
Wast of money.....!!!
Too Much Better For Baby
Product is not bad but it leaks when baby got loose motion..can be better .
Must buy 5 star premium for your babies
"6 month old child, wearing medium sized pamper, all flexible and soft etc. but leaves"
red marks on her waist. Make waistband a bit loose
Nice discount. Genuine.
Though i'm a regular buyer of pamper pants this time i found 3 of them leaking within 2 hrs of usage so definitely there is a room of improvement for quality check.
The product is extremely kids friendly. It’s a relief for parents. No leakage in the mid night. Absolutely satisfied. I strongly recommend this as the material is really good my baby never had any rashes.
Pampers is like Colgate  for toothpaste
Never used any other thing
Very like good product
I m using only pampers for my child however 1st time disappointed from Amazon as I got the opened pack of diapers. As their is no return policy of this product feeling bad for the same.
Worst product. It is just like paper. My suggestion is not to buy this.
This is not having return policy also. This is nothing but looting the customers.
Best price with coupon
We are very happy with this one. Bought for 600
Very bad quality product....never thought pamper will sell product like this.. Amazon do not sell this product  as it's hamper your image....
Very disappointed...
"I was delivered L size, whereas I ordered for XL size. This is very wrong .. I only noticed after couple of days when I realised that the pants were fitting too tight."
last time i received broken package and pampers are came out from the pampers bag
"No dought the product is good, but at the same price I can buy from big bazar then why I will order from Amazon. This is why I bought from big bazar."
This time product quality is very poor...
I'm using this product for my kid from last one n half year..but I think this time it's duplicate..
Please cross check before buying..
Good stuff Cloudtail is just best I believe
Best product for ur baby
"Material quality is not gud, I don't know it's concern of seller or Amazon but truth is that first time I facing quality issue with pamper XL size. It seems second quality. Just waist of money."
"It is the best diaper pants available, it have better absorbency mechanism than any other pants. It is also feels very soft. Got it very less price as compared to local market."
Out of 76 pieces more than 10 pieces are leaked..  equalling to <76. No profit in buying it
This is a top brand for babies and it’s best to go for baby’s comfort. Super soft and cottony. It’s really easy to use and quite affordable.
Almost all the diapers leaking in after sometime.  I have used other pamper packs but almost all in this pack are horrible
"Pampers is good that every one knows, but the delivery by Amazon is not worthy. The pack is opened. It's visible very clear after opening the box. How come such cheap tricks played here."
Best price available in amazon and quality is same
"It's good but the previous pampers would last for more time as gvn 12 hrs ,this one last not more than 7 hrs.But still good"
This pampers pant is leaking. Earlier i bought pamper pant from market and i was completely satisfied with it. It is completely useless product and waste of money. Please dont buy this.
i use this every 🌃 night for my lo..it's comfortable
"Very happy with it, we use these only"
This is the best brand used ever. No rashes no leaking.. other brand al doesn’t last overnight.. simply go for this.. best value for money.. wen comes to quality pampers beat al other brands
"Pampers are better than other options like huggies,mamy, Himalaya etc.."
Looks like it's small
Totally damaged product
Good product...Good absorbency.
But smells a little bit.
it should be 38 X 4 pack
instead of 76 X 2
More comfort n best for baby... Absorbency is so good... n soft for baby....thank you Amazon n thank you Pampers
Very very worst.. i hvlave order l size
 they delivered new born size.  There is no cotton spinges in pampers. Only plastic cover is there.  Amazon dealing worst products.
I like this.good absorbency & leack proof quality is very good
Easily absorb for 10 hr
"Recieved duplicate pack , daiper is continuously leaking within 20-30 minutes only... u people cheated by giving false item"
This was a duplicate product. It can't even hold a single time pee. Very much disappointed. This was the first time line was so worst. I am purchasing pampers from last 2 years in amezon
My baby is very discomfort in these pampers....the elastic and quality is not original.... He is getting a red blue line on his thighs.... Waste of money
Nappy is good and soft but make sure to apply coconut oil or nappy cream before putting new nappy.  It can cause rashes  otherwise.
I will always select pampers above all the other diaper brand because if its softness and light in weight.
I never compromise with my baby health and will always suggest pampers pants
A very nice product i would like to recommend all for pampers.
I used to buy this pamper everymonth. But the size of the pampers this time looking like small size pamper. Medium size pamper which used to be fix to my kid is fully tight this time..
"Worth the money, definitely cheaper than local market"
Out of 86 diapers near about 50% of them were not proper.  The stiches were very losse and it started to leak because of them. Very much disappointed with the product.  Waste of money.
"Good material , durable and very easy to use. For Amazon it is better to increase the efficiency of transportation at Kollam. It was at Kollam Amazon centre for more than two days"
it is too good ...my baby is heavy weater
...still it works fabolously
This set of papmers was bad. It smelled like poop all the time. Must have been old stock. The ones used earlier the small ones were of good quality
"This time ur product is very bad, ghatiya. Durability is only for three hours, not for all night. If possible please return my half used packet which gifted by me to someone."
Perfect brand and quality as compare to all other brands.
Good quality product and i always buy pampers for my baby since from her birth. Really happy with the product and the price also less compared with shops
Doesn’t hold on beyond 6hrs and potty is completely leaked out
Price is similar to medical stores
Material quality should improve
This product is magical wear for baby...This product is one of the best for baby feel comfortable and sleep in deep with peace....
"This is not the original product , child is getting sick. I had to throw the remaining diapers as return window was closed before I could interpret the reason for sickness and rashes."
"Is there any no star option to choose ?Bakwaas and third class quality, waste of money, don't buy this just because of the name, it's not fulfilling the purpose. Try Snuggles Diapers."
It's a great product.... material is very soft and rash free..magic gel Locks wetness up to 12 hours ...but I use 3 to 4 daipers daily...it's very good for my little princess
Recieved today.. I ordered june 21.. Within 3 days i have recieved.. Good quality👍 softness also.. Thank u amazon💜💜  Everyone Must buy😊
Absorbency not so much.
Good Quality. Absorbs fast. Easy to use and leak proof. Baby can wear it for long period of time without getting rahes
"I purchased this product with discount, quality is not good when compared to the original price product.i don't know whether it is an original or duplicate"
This new version is very poorly designed. It's very thin and narrow due to which it is leaking most of the times.
It's so soft nd very good am fully satisfied  its awsum tq
I must say the old pamper pants were much better than new. New pamper pants don't last for long and leakage is a big issue. Please improve the quality or bring old one back.
My baby is happy with this napkin
"Good absorption,stays overnight, we sometimes question ourself whether used or unused"
"Monthly pack Quality not good , we regularly take 68 count pack,its good,  but first time we tried monthly pack, very thin and leakage is happening."
My baby got rashes due to this product .. even before I used pampers but  my baby didn't get any rashes .. the quality of the product now I received is not upto expectation.
The diapers are leaking and tierred off while using. My baby got rashes after this packet use. It seems like a copy of main product. Poor quality. Buyers please be cautious.
It is light weight and gives a nice snug feeling without being too bulky for my baby. The material soaks up really well keeping it dry n thus my baby feels very comfortable.
I AM PURCHASING PAMPERS FOR MY BABY FOR 4 YEARS FROM AMAZON. BUT THIS TIME I THINK IT IS A DUPLICATE OF PAMPERS. I AM NOT RETURNING IT BECAUSE I USED ONE  DIAPER FOR MY BABY
Pamper new large pant is comfortable for baby and it does not leak throughout night and no rashes on baby skin. Happy with pamper new large diaper pant.
It's good. Absorbency is not that great. In rainy days need to change it every 4-5 hours.
Product is amazing. Really like the product. Pampers Brand is trustworthy and it doesn't cause irritation to baby and is leak proof
Size of xl is reduced. Now my 12kg toddler is not able to wear it properly as it fits tight to him. Earlier the size was ok and easy to wear.
Nice product with minimum leakage and friendly to baby
Add description how to destroy after the use
Pampers are best night time diapers. The absorbency is excellent.
Totoally waste of money ... I dont know why the large size of pamper's qualtiy is pathetic as i have used m size that was grt but this is is really fake .
This is very good product. Its absorbency and softness is good and also leak proof.
"Best diaper available on market till date. I've used huggies, mamy poko pants, himalaya. But nothing satisfied me. Pampers dry pants is the best in terms of abosorbancy and softness."
It’s the worst product. The diaper quality is soo cheap. I guess it’s not the original pampers product. I just throwed the whole diaper box as myself felt the quality cheap and rough
The brand pampers is leak proof not absorb so much but softness is good than other brands
good quality product with less price
All time favourite brand
"It's good one, everything is fine"
Excellent
It is best brand among all available in market. Its absorbing power is awesome...its leak proof. its make baby dry and comfort whole night. There is no side effect on skin.
All the diapers in pack are useless. Dont buy diapers from amazon. Seems duplicate and faulty product is sold on amazon.
Gel was coming out from diapers. No leak proof at all.
Don’t think it’s a genuine product. My baby got rashes. This is the first time he got it. We have been using pampers since birth.
Leak proof and good softness
"As i buy this product for my son regularly,"
product is good and packing is also god.
overall nice.
Not soft. Not good
All I can say you will never go wrong with pampers
It leaks within 6 hours
"Very nice,easy to use,but sometimes when my 2month old baby poops it leaks..but nothing made issue"
It's very poor quality product. Hardly suitable for 1-2hr after that start leakage. I recommend huggies and extra absorb. These can be used for more than 6-8 hr and it's never leak.
"Using for last 3 months around, no irritation to baby, very comfortable and value for the money. Good service, best product, packaging was good. Go 4 it."
Reasonable Price at this kind of product
Best brand and takes care of babys skin. No rashes if changed every 5-6 hours. Best for entire night peaceful sleep for baby and mother.
Diapers are extremely bad.... Its leaking during the first 30 mins itself... It is possible tht the product delivered is a duplicate one
Nice and my baby dont have rashes.
My baby is very comfortable in this . Till now no rashes also. With month lt pack Amazon gives very good discount
It is better than any other company product.It is leak proof unlike others.I love this product because it's very comfortable for my kiddo.He sleeps really great with these diapers..
"It's very good ... My baby is 4 month old and m using it for her for whole night ... She is comfortably sleep ... No leakage... her skin is completely dry ,good absorbance power ..."
My baby's weight is 11kg but still it is tight on her thigh.sometimes it leakes.kindly take return and replace the item with XL size
Good product. Better than Huggies
"As Expected, 100% satisfied! Kudos team Amazon!"
Good product.But very difficult to dispose
I am happy with this product. Completely satisfied and strongly recommend.
its comfertable for my kid and good material as well.
"This product is very nice and perfect for my baby while sleeping. Highly absorbing, extremely soft and it fits his comfort. I really feel very useful as my baby gets peaceful sleep."
This product is very useful for new born baby. It is fully hygienic and not any problem in it. And this is very comfortable and it is light weight. It is easy to use and leak proof.
Now It's Degraded Model.. now. it's leaking fast.. the model before this. new one was faaaaar better.. this one gr8 failure
I have a doubt that weather it's original pamper or not as after 6hrs its starts leaking
O uswdnonly 2 diapers and now wish to return it but that's not possible
Very poor quality.dont buy this product from this Amazon. It's 100% duplicate. Didn't expect this type of quality from Amazon
Good but last time material quality down..
Nice product lite weigh and soft in camparision to other brand and cheaper also
I like this product very much super absorving very comfortable for baby
i purchased the same product from a local shop. huge difference in quality.
 please don't buy.
"Im a regular user of pampers , I have ordered for XL pants but this time the diaper size is small as compared to all my previous purchases. There is some mistake I think. Please look into this matter. Thanks"
Better than any diaper pants in this class.
Very bad quality. Can't even hold for 2 hours forget about whole night.
Diaper leaked within 2 hours. Please don't buy pampers. I think they are selling fake pampers on amazon
Duplicate product.....
Very very bad quality...
Lickeg problem after 2 hours...
Please dont purchase this product..
TOTALLY ''FALTU'' PRODUCT
Leak proof is poor
Wrong item chosen
Value for money. No leaking issues and the baby is comfortable. One diaper is enough for one night (8hours)
New Pampers launched is really good and the more softer feel makes baby very comfortable
"Really a good product, look small but work long hours."
Material is soft no rashes on baby skin its a great product also magic gel that locks wetness work upto 12 hours and keep dryness lock. Its new and improved product very satisfied.
Cheaper then pamper active and good to use for few hours.
Product is good and purchased in 716 rupees even I have prime membership but same product got in 640 rupees from firstcry store
Wonderful  smell .... Good quality.... I prefer more family to buy this product...
Nice and useful for baby. We are getting in reasonable price from Amazon.  Soft and comfortable for baby.
Everything is perfect but it should be more soft.
Extremely bad quality this time. The gel is coming out from the diapers. Diapers are becoming full in a single fee. I want my money to be returned. This is not acceptable
Never buy pampers .I always buy many poko pants this time I purchased pampers Bec of the offer but the quality was very poor there r some blanks spaces between the cotton
Very comfortable and no leakage
As like new go for it
It's alovera gel and better absorbed quality keeps my baby rash free and dry for long period of time.
It's touch is so much cottony that it keeps my baby comfortable.
Should b rap properly
"I have not used any of the other brand the day I switched to pampers!! This was on s relative’s feedback... I m satisfied with all aspects of the product quality, fit, durablilty!"
Very good product.
Some of the pieces are having manufacturing defect. It is leaking.... And not at all absorbing
"I ordered for one mega pack and got two medium sized packs only. Anyways, my purpose is fulfilled but the pack size should be as per order specifications given in the application."
"Product is doubtless, but ensure you get a good discount."
The quality of products is very worst bcos of leaked out very often and materials seem to very low
Baby getting ithyness on her sides
Good one.. as they say in the ad its not 1 pampers equals 1 dry night... Baby skin getting wet by 6 to 7 hours...  So its secure to use it for 4 to 5 hours.....
This BP monitor is nice product from Health Sense. I have purchased this few days week back and it is worth the price. It is quite simple to use and I loved it.
"I am using pampers for my baby from the birth.She feels very comfortable as itis soft and she feel dry evertime.No leakage,long time absorbence and easy to use as it's pant style."
Good quality product and timely delivery
the dipper need to be little more comfertable for use.. thik ness is reduced but price was same..
Product quality was nice.My lil one always feel so comfortable with pampy pants and will have continuous deep sleep at night...Absorption quality was nice compared to other diapers...
"Pampers are soft, highly absorbent and comfortable. Its keeps my baby dry through all night and rash free also."
"Absorbency,leakproof & soft for baby"
Not durable at all. Have to change after one pee by baby
Not good for baby. Never use pampers at home. Causes infection
The material is not good. As the cotton sticks on the reproductive part of my baby
Excellent Product from Pampers comfortable for babies
"Durable, good material, easy to use, smooth on baby skin"
This brand have let my cousin have a good night sleeping him dry from 10pm to 7am. Well done pampers. This nappies are very also very comfortable and flexible. Highly recommended.
I like it...... My baby was feeling like a good and comfortable...  Tanks amazon
Worst product...  Have been using huggies n mammy poko...  Thought of trying pampers...  Doesn't even stay for 1.5 hours now starts leaking...
Product quality issues..
"It's leak proof, effective in absorbency"
The quality of the product is reduced. The diaper gets full in a very short time. Never expected this out of pampers. Made a mistake of taking mega monthly box.
It's soft and easy to use. Quality is moderate. With the money
These are best diapers..
My order pampers (L) size Amazon delivered (s) size diaper big mistake from packaging
"Is good and with perfume smell,quality is excelent,and easy to use"
"Local shopkeepers refused to provide 5% discount, infact I asked for 10%. Thanks to Amazon, getting best quality in affordable price."
"I had buy pamper befor also for my 8 month  babywhich was much batter, but this time its started leaking with in 2, 3 hr,,,,,"
Perfect fit and very comfortable for my baby.. No leak  and very soft
happy to purchase .
Recommended to all
"I regularly use this for my baby, but this time it seems to be duplicate product. It started licking in 1 hours of use."
Excellent product for babies.. my baby is loving it.
"Have bought this item many times, but previous order product was duplicate/fake. it leaked from anywhere. Non reliable. I was using L size, but brought XL for next use. Shockingly both diapers were of same size."
genuine product
"Worst diapers ever. The material is so crunchy, cant imagine it being comfortable against baby's skin. They leak a lot. My child woke up practically every night soaked."
Very bad product....they have given me duplicate product.
Not value for money. either should increase the quality of product or should decrease the price of the product
Value for money
its the best product. no rashes. no allergy. fully absorbent. gives a peaceful sleep to my baby. pampers pant r more comfortable than diaper (wrap around) and easy to make my baby wear.
"Low quality material(pampers),pampers goto bad smell after 2,3 hours later.."
Deserves 5 star. Absolutely worth off. A very good product with awesome durability. Love it. Nd yes 5 star for cloudtail as well for timely delivery & proper packaging.
Excellent no words to say
"Very good quay, soft and safe for Baby."
Excellent product received
Value for money
Super good
It has good absorbing capacity. Leak proof and gives a comfort sleep for the baby. The latest aloe-vera gel technology keeps the area dry and hygienic as well as gives a nice frangnance
Value for money recommended
Not sure if the product delivered was original as the baby was not comfortable at all after wearing the diaper and it leaked thus failing the entire purpose of wearing a daiper.
The best quality diapers. I am using pampers for my lo from her birth and never ever faced any issue of rashes or leakage. They are easy to use and good for night usage as well.
Its really pampering my baby...best one...
The quality is very good. Thin diaper but soaks very well...
The quality is good and very cheap comparing to retailers. Thanks a lot to Amazon.
"Absorbenc quality not good, 11:00 P.M. to Morning 7:00A.M.  daily use two Pampers some time three,  Large or XL size almost same not much difference."
Very good quality product...
"Mainly i dont use diaper for my baby but during night it is must to have pampers and even in journey , any function or party..it is very comfort"
"It is mentioned M size in the package but actually it is S size. So who want M size pant , please order L size. Otherwise it will not fit."
Many diapers in this products not absorb.
I am like purchasing from cloudtail seller.gud products and on time delivery.keep it up cloudtail and keep serving us always the same quality.
"It is leak proof, very soft and absorb very good"
Good  as always
The product is good i mostly use pampers for my baby it can be wore for long periods of time without leakage problem.
Nt fit for my baby other diper se chota h
worth for money
Don’t buy it because it’s not good enough. At first time it’s leak..
"Very good diaper comparing to others, fit properly for my lil one.it is leak proof diaper and lasting for 10 to 12 hours for my baby. Its material is too soft and fit properly."
That person who delivered rhe product (Pamper) He dont know how to talk to the lady or costumor.The way his talking so badly.His name is BRIJESH.plz some action for this agent.
The pamper is to small it's not large. The package says it's large size but the fitting is of small size
"Just waste of money ,  my son wear it only 2-3 hr and its start leaking its fake product don't buy it from here."
Compared to old diapers this new diaper s hardly last for few hours.  In 3 hrs diaper gets full n den wets the clothes.  Old ones used to pay for whole night
Very nice product from trusted brand.. very comfortable.. best fitting.. skin friendly and very soft and leak proof..
"Good quality and last for whole night, for my kid"
Leaked after wearing...not at all satisfied
Nice quality.. No rashes or irritation..
Good quality product!
Keep doing good work.
It is mentioned that one pamper is for one night. But its not the real case. It gets leaked in the middle of the night also
A trustable product for your kid.
The monthly box is worth buying.  Price can be kept a bit on the lower side as few hyper markets are selling with bit lesser price.
Good product maine 3 bar buy kiya h
Just one problem I need 12 hour protection dont leekg... but this product just 4 to 6 hour protection that's it............
This product is too tight for babies.. leave marks on skin...n feels wet in very short time...the premium products are good in comparison to this...
"I bought this for my new born. First it didn't fit correctly they were too loose, then they started to leak. My baby is of normal weight. It turned out to be useless."
This pack of pampers is fake. I am using pampers for my baby since his birth and the original one is best and purcgase this product which is totally fake and can say just copy of orignal one.
Good product.
These things should be cheaper...
"Product is gud but I feel sizes are smaller than other product, for healthy baby just check size first by using smaller pack"
NICE Quality  and very soft and comfortable to use baby
The diaper quality is worst as it can not support overnight leakage. I have been using Huggies but never had compail bit this time I ordered Pampers the quality is worst .
Very good product. My baby is always happy in pampers.
"Worst product... What a waste please dont buy this product.. This is completely nonsense, completely fake... Damn thin, not usable... I lost my trust I have in Amazon today..."
Good product..easy to use..no leakage
Nice 👌 product value for money
This very good problem is same time it's leaking
Nice experience to child
Quality degraded.. kind of duplicate pampers..
Need to improve quality.product is good but it gets leak sometimes.
Very thin.so don't long lasting.maximum 3hrs leakage proof
"Like the cover says all night dry, it does work indeed."
"The quality of product is very poor, poo is leaking, even normal cloth is better than this.. Its waste of money and it happen 2nd time for me and I never purchase now"
When I used pampers in USA they were better and softer.In india the quality is ok.
The pampers I accept received is fake. The material is absolute rubbish and it isn't holding Yeh amount of liquid it's supposed to so where one would require 4 diapers in a day I'm using up 10.
The pampers cover was tored and i am not sure whether number is intact or not. This shows there is lack of quality check in place. This is least expected from Amazon
Happy to buy this product from amazon. Easy delivery and easy to to pay cash. This product's quality good and easy to use. Thank u amazon.
Good product
Diapers are great but I don't know why amazon wants to waste such big cartons over the P&G carton packing
Good product but got one without the aloe vera
Poor quality used once when the packet opens it was not the quality which was received in the starting guys u have standard kindly check the product verified before u deliver
Good
Best for babies for quick absorbency n feels baby very comfort
Wonderful product and the quality is so good for your child. I tried many brands but now I prefer this brand only.
"When use this product, red rashes on skin of little baby, i purchase 2 pct of 76 pc packing, so request to change."
Tried different dipers but got rashes but this one was good for my daughter.
"I am using this for my Son and found it very soft for his skin.Never faced any issue or complain like skin rashes, leakage issue etc."
My kid got rashies after prolonged use.
Better to change it or use it for not more than 2 hr.
From 22 pieces half of the quantity was torn from sides so half packet got wasted... We buy expensive diapers nt to waste our money... Quality was pathetic
It's an average product
Not at all good..looks like duplicate diapers..very bad quality
Value for money
I thought I can get a bunch full for a good price through monthly pack but quality is not good when compared to regular pampers .Planning to shift to another brand.
Pampers is not compared to other products.
The quality of the pampers is very good
This bunch of diapers is either too old or something else is wrong with them. It’s leaking just 10 minutes after changing. I need some solution for this.
Very very good
Thank you pampers
This product is so much good...and it is too much soft...
Very poor quality... Cant use for more than one hour.. dnt buy this pls....Waste of money
Price could be little low
It is leakproff and no rashes but the elastic is pretty tight and left marks on the baby. Don't recommend.
Good Product
It absorbs evenly and doesnt get heavy. my baby is comfortable with pampers
Good product. Leak proof and soft
Best ever used
This product is best one for small babies. You can feel the dryness in the diapers after the use. I recommend this for parents to use it once and feel the difference
Material quality is good along with good absorption capacity
Easy to use as pant style diaper also durable to use at night 1diaper = 1 night
Good quality and material.
Good absorbent and no leakage.
Very comfortable for my baby.
No rashes.
Thank you papmers
Great product
Looked different from the one available in market
Poor quality
"Never had a problem with pampers, ever. Comfortable, light weight, and no leakage. I’m very happy with how fast I receive them..will order again!"
New pamper diaper quality is very poor...  These diapers use only 1-2 hour for baby & More leackage problem. Old pamper diaper quality is very good...  But new one is very low quality.
"Very good diapers with promising functionality of Absorbencey, Leak proofness and Softness. Thoroughly satisfied with the product and the discount was the icing on the cake."
"Amezing product... Using it for my baby since Day 1 and it's very light in weight, haven't found any rashes on baby skin.. must buy for your baby"
Definitely not durable and not at all leak proof. My baby's clothes are getting wet time and again. Not at all suggested.
"New design that release 3 months back is not good durability , facing thought time due to leakage even if used for less than 4 hrs"
Very disappointed with the product. Low quality. Never expected this quality form such a brand. Low absorbency capacity.
Extremely poor product...this is the worst product I have ever get it from Amazon....I think it's not the original product. I have using pamper bran d for my since he born.
Ok normal compare to old model this little cheap quality
The quality is not good. It's too thin. Not absorbing properly. Even after use of 3 hrs its start leaking
3rd class product justlike duplicate product
I found it good but it become more comfortable if it came wid wetness indicator in this range like Himalaya baby diapers because sometimes baby face trouble if we forgot change diapers
It absobs little. Also not leak proof
My regret after purchase.
Won't recommend to anyone
Product is good and packing was excellent.
"Really amazing product, tried all other brands but when I started using it, really loved it, no leaks, good absorption, long lasting, most recommended for babies in diapers"
Very Poor!!
Too thin is not suitable for babies. Every night its get leak and baby not comfortable to get sleep.
Pampers pants have been my choice since my baby was born bcoz of it's soft diapers my baby has never got a rash and they are easy to use and leak proof !
"Quality is Not up to mark, Diaper  leaked in 2 hrs only, very thin as  compared  to Tata product & Momy poko panty extra absorber"
Urine overflow daily. It seems it's another diaper under pamper box. Poor quality. I already used pamper before but it was not as before. Bad experience this time
"Material is poor quality,it's not original Pampers."
"Super is getting filled in 1 or 2 hours, earlier it is 6-8hrs...size is smaller than usual size, I bought large size, but it looks like small size"
Looks like a fake product supplied by Cloudtail. Such thin quality and nowhere in comparison with Mamy Poko pants whose quality is excellent.
For two years baby using large size. She is 10 kg. But it leaks after 2 times urine.
Waste of the product and quality within 2hours it is liking before it was good but not now.
Very bad product
Its small
I got xl for my 12 kg boy nd the diaper is small
Product supplied is not good in quality it's gel content /part rapture after on or two times of use so can't be used for longer stays/whole night
Or during child play
This product is not good quality. Diaper leakage after 4 hrs. Change again and again. Totally wastage of money....very bad product.....
Good diaper
It is gud bt jb baby one side agar sota rh gya raat bhar to pee one side hokar bahar leak karta h.. Ya mai agar usko baar baar side change krwau to its actually best...
Easy to use
Quality wise it could have been even better as the absorbancy of the diaper is not that great
It's a great product.. helps my baby to sleep at night comfortably without any irritation.. it's absorbency is excellent ... Need not worry about changing often or leakage
Pampers are always best
others are offering at better discount
"I love pampers and trust them for my baby. These diapers are truly soft, give a dry feel and leak proof. My baby feels very comfortable and I am sorted."
"There is nothing wrong with diaper,they are good,but the time taken to deliver is more,as in shopping sites like Firstcry we get the diaper the next day"
"The absorbancy power is optimum lasts for 6-7 hours ,without any skin problems ,however there were 2-3 occasions of leakage Overall fair product,it suited well.."
As described
"Great consistent quality, Premium range is just awesome. Maintained trust in their product."
"Overall good, it's better if improve minor defects."
Like product
Value for money
This new Pampers (Air channels) xl 128 is not good is waste stands only for one hour and does not distribute wetness evenly. waste of money for this monthly mega pack....
Good deal
Very Good Price
Pampers is leak proof and absorbency is also very good. Thumbs up to Pampers 👍
In your offer 152 piece is that..but me only got 132..This is very cheating..If product have don't any offer do not put..also delivered not in my home.I taken from your office..
I have been purchasing this product for around 2 yrs and the product is really good when compared with its competitors
Two type of diaper inside the pack...newer or older...new one is good but old one is very disgusting....pamper and amazone disappointe me  for this cheap quality material
Pampers is very comfortable and light . Moreover is it leak proof and rash free. I m using this for my baby for very long.  Really happy with the quality of the product ♥
Each and every diaper was top notch
The material is very good very soft for new born babies.. It's very easy to easy..  The absorbent helps the baby to have sound sleep..
good price for bulk order
If i get more discount then i will be happy
Many time I  bought pamper large size but last time the quality of product was changed diaper leaked very fast I was disappointed with the product...😒
super product no leakage no wetness my baby happy to slp long time at nyt
Favorite brand
Good product but belt is tight .
Tape style diapers always good for baby...wetness indiactor is good
Very bad and duplicate product. My baby gets rashes and infection after using it. Really very bad product. Please don't use this product for your little hearts.
Price should be low.. in market we are getting Same quality and quantity in very less price. Better to go for dmart or relience mart...we will get more discount
"I would like to give thanks to this company. this product is very <a href=""https://dailyresult.in"">useful and important</a> for my kids."
Very comfortable for baby. Easy to use. My only concern is the recycling if it was eco-friendly.
Perfect diapers for toddlers and infants.l
Good product
Softness and absorbency.. recommended
Good product
Good one
"Product received is not good this time durability & material is pathetic, this is the first time from this vendor received such a quality. Regularly every month used to order."
Comfortable n soft product
Good Material easy to use and very soft
Keeps baby dry for whole night
"Best among all diapers brands availablein market, absorbs large amount of pee"
This is the best in terms of quality and price
Small size also available in the pack
"I have been using pampers since my baby was born and m super happy with the product.. and as always, amazonservice has been amazing!!"
Very soft and good product
Excellent product
Ad usual good
Huggies is much better then this
Doesn't have absorbing capability like the previous ones.
Quality of Papers is worst. It's getting very thin day by day. Babies cant wear more than 3hrs. It's start leaking after that. I never going to recommend to anyone on pampers. Ppl be aware.
Nice diaper.
Satisfied
Nice one
Quality is fantastic
I used pampers since one year for my baaby
"faithful, never deceive, reliable brand."
Excellent
Good as always
Duplicate Product... Can’t use... Waste of money
Good product value for money
Best one
Good no waste piece recieved. Baby comfortable in this.
"Product is really bad,  we are getting a feeling of duplicate."
Leaking even after the kid pees once or twice...
We are seeing this  issue mostly with the monthly boxes.
After trying couple of brands i can easily say this one gives u value for your money.
"Does wht it says, keeps the baby dry and less chances of rashes for the baby."
The pampers in India is really poor quality compared  to the one we buy in UK . Pampers for sure sells substandard products in India
"Original pempers diapers received, good quality and durable as well"
Item tampered
Absorbency needs to be better
Softness
"Overall a good product, I can highly recommend to go for it in all aspects like aboorbency, leak proof and softness."
Good quality
Good quality item
Very good quality diapers I always trust pampers for my baby.
This is the worst product I brought. No replacement at all. Please check before you buy.

Regular
Good but leaks sometimes
Price we wanted to be less for permanent customer

Pampers diapers was of good material. My lo who is 6 months old didn't get any rashes and it held up the urine for a long time.
Not an original product
Material quality is poor . I wouldnt recommend to anyone because diapers rips off from the side.Its not safe for the babies they might put that stuff in mouth or eyes.
Good one more then better

This new package duper’s are not Fiting properly on side ways to baby. Please work on this. Quality was not great. Before one was good compared to the new one air. Please think on this.
Good product value for money
Perfect for infants and kids especially in journeys apart from regular full night usage
Additional aloe vera gel is good but the thickness of pamper is low.previous pampers are very good in thickness and absorbing also.
My Baby is well protected. Thank you Pampers. It would be good if Amazon can give special discount on Pampers to Regular Customers.
Pampers new diaper pants Is very soft absorbency leak proof for all night my baby sleep very comfortable . I love this pamper pants
Best for my baby

It has aloe vera lotion that make the baby skin smooth.
Very very worst quality of material. Unfortunately opened the pack after the returnable period lapsed. Wanna return the two packs out of three packs ordered. Kindly help
Quality Product
Good but not excellent
"Good material,soft,comfortable elastic.much better soaking capacity...1pamper=1night that is really true..in my point of view now pamper is a no1 diaper..."
Good product and nice quality! But price is too high in flipcart the price is low as compared to others...But your service is excellent...Reach in time.
Useless product without wetness indicater
Good quality.
Not so good
"totally waste of money , worst quality , leaking in just three hours. Do not purchase from Amazon. Amazon have worst quality products , attracting by giving discount."
Excellent
Good product
I can not give one star also. This is not genuine product my baby got rashes after using it. Amazon Should look into this.
"Very thing is fine except it get filled before the time they mentioned, more often we have to change the diaper"
Size fits and leak proof.
Baby feels comfortable because material is very nice.
Delivery was also fast.
Wanted to return this but its not returnable as i had ordered this thinking it to be XL size as per the image but it is actually L
After birth of my baby I use pampers diapers only..till now she is 15 months and don't have diaper rash problem..love this product

Recommend to all new moms
Much better than poko pants
Every baby's requirement :)
But market me usse cheap hai
Elasticity
good product but very poor delivery service
Worth money
Costly and not good finish. Above all Israeli product.
"I m a huge fan of pampers.The comfort which it provides is d best for d baby,my baby is always 24*7 in diapers.i find pampers one of d best product for baby"
Absorbency is average.. Leakage is there if used for more than four hours.. Price as compared to other brands like huggies is high..product is almost same..
Super
We used pampers and it was good.. but this seems to be a fake. Worst product..
Good quality.
Easy to use .
Very poor absorbing capacity.  U have to keep checking it every 15 mins which defeats the purpose of using a diaper.  Don't use it at all.  STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED.
Waste of money. It leaks after 2 hours. I think this is a pirated product. Stop buying. Amazon is going worse day by day. It's really sad.
Very good product
Comfort
Very bad product.. i got cheated. This diapers cant hold urine properly even for an hour. Some get tear by side when wear itself... pls.. pls.. dont ever buy this...
"Wonderful diaper pants... comfortable and safe on baby skin , very helpful for parents... lasts for longer hours..without making the baby irritated... thanks pampers"
We been using pampers since long time but this one is not as other pampers what we received in future
This one is most of the pampers pants are leaking
Very good quality
Not a fine quality
Excellent

Market and amazon pempers to be different. Its better then market pempers quality. This is duplicate and local product.

Material quality... I feel the quality is bad(leakage problem) when compare to previous packet. I can able see the inner stuff is not properly stuffed in the diaper.
"This is not returnable, dont buy, the customer service is poor, waste of money for me"
"this product is good material,durability & ease to use"
Pampers dry pants are really good and can go up till 12hours absorbent material used is of very good quality loved it than the previous pampers I have used
Its fake product not actual size and my baby have many Rashes I think I sue you.

Good
Disappointed with the product....not even worth for a single star....didnt expect this kind of duplicate product from Amazon....
Size is smaller than other same category diapers. Water leaks in overnight use. I need to chage twice every night. Not satisfied
Good
I want change this product because my children baby very bad after use
Its good for urine absorbence but potty is getting leaked everytime
Best in its class. Nothing compares to pampers in terms of quality.
Good
"For same quality and same brand Cheaper than market, fast delivery"
Have been using pampers from the 1st monthof my baby. Never experienced such a worst absorbing capacity. It is leaking just after an hour. Will not buy Pampers ever
Softness and absorbency
This product is a duplicate product from Amazon. I have used pampers before. It was not like that. From this packet the gel leaks from the baby's diaper in the middle of the night.
This product was not good and was substandard.. Provided with low quality material. The Pampers was not able to absorb urine for even one night..
Thanks for Good Quality and fast shipping
Very soft and nice product by Pampers and Amazon. My baby is very happy with these. It works the whole night. I recommend these monthly packs to everyone.
Very bad product its leak very early and also it’s burst every time your baby uses the diaper very bad diaper
Such a poor quality from pampers and amazon
"Very bad quality, my lo had rashes when used."
Normal
Good
"Very poor qulity, waste of money. I will not recommend. Very cherp and 3rd class qulity material,"
Nice product
"Good product, but not absorbed much"
Good
"good product, baby is happy"
Really good product
Excellent product for baby
Quality of product is so cheap. After every 3 hours maximum diaper leaks. Amazon sells duplicate product. Don't but from Amazon. Otherwise Pampers diapers are good
This new product is fake.cheapest quality I ever seen Since one year we are using pampers for my son.This is the first time I am changing for every hour.Don't buy it
"The quality has gone down drastically, the local made diapers are better than this now."
Easy to use and great quality
Nice product at competitive price
Doesn't absorb more
ALl good.. nice product..
Pampers has good quality diapers for kids I have been using it since he was new born and I am liking the quality no complains of rashes as on date
My Baby is 5 kg so ordered Small Size Diaper.  But leaks every time. I would suggest not to use pants in place use some normal diapers.
"Pampers are best for baby, material quality is good, absorb more.moreover due to pant style very easy to use. Goodnight sleeping of baby .baby remain dry ."
"Quality is not good, very light dipper, small for 12 year child"
Not so good
"I didn't got the original Pamper diaper.. I am buying since 2 years, this time i got different pamper product...Material quality is not so good.."
good deal and the package reach as mentioned. thanks
From the very first day am using it for my baby so I have full faith on it.
I waisted my money & lost belief over Pampers.Leaking all waist.
Like
Price worthy. But one diper is not enough for even 6 hour of dryness
Nice product
GOOD
"Very poor quality. It gives secretion during night hours, because it losts for 4-6 hours."
Old quota was very very good. But disappointed by this one
NEED FULL
Ok
ok
I doubt this is fake not the real one
Product quality not good
I. Was using the old dry pants and tried the new. They are soft with good material.
Made of non biodegradable substance and causing lot of pollution in small towns.
It's a best price so far compare to retail market
nice
fit well and absorb well..
"Great product. Best absorbency, leakage proof. Comfortable for about 8 hours. My baby poops in it but it is leak proof. My 4 months old feels so comfortable in it"
very good
Size is too small 5 kg k baby ko tight h bhut ilastic k nisaan pad gye not good according to size nhi h
Good
"Genuine product,  no issues observed"
Best daipers
Pampers is always the Best for babies.
works well
Thank you
"overall good performance, sometime leak, i think in air it is more thicker then before, so leakage issue is increasing"
Worthy watch with the amount
Soft for baby skin
Good
Leaks Everytime. Have been using the same from Firstcry and never leaked. Ordered from Amazon and it leaks every time.
Nice
Nice diapers but pampers packing quality is not good
Very good
Worst diapers which I have ever purchased for kids. Total use less
Good
"It is with aloevera lotion showing in pic but i received without aloevera , reguler & old one"
That is causing rashes.
Gud
Ok product
Good product!!!
This is the nth time I am buying this for my toddler and we trust this. It is soft and safe for night time diapering .
bought this because of brand name and satisfied with my decision. Size accurate for my 11 months baby. Diapers are soft and having good absorb capacity.
This product is extremely okay..is not leak proof..the material is also thin compared to the normal ones..and the size is small too...dont buy!
This is 12the time i am ordering this.  First of all the packaging was good.  I never faced any old or damaged issue as other buyers mentioned.
Good but need some softness
Like
They are good but premium pants are much better
"Very bad quality , highly dissapointed..."
want to return as the diaper leaked also....
Worst product i hv ever came across...
Want my money refund
Awesome product
Product is bad quality compare to purchase from outside
Excellent quality of the absorbent material. I use it overnight for my baby and he sleeps really well. Easy to wear and remove for the baby without creating fuss. Amazing product.
Best quality at reasonable prices.
"Totally nice Product By amazon. Price is very reasonable as compared to other brands. The quality is well worth. In short, treat this review as a recommendation."
The product is awesome and most importantly is the delivery of product at the right time ...thanku Amazon thanku pampers for timely response...u made my day easy
👍👍👍
"I think it is a second class product,very low quality,buy in shop only."
Amazon plz don't encourage this kind of products.
"There is no wetness indicator, elastic is to tight for my 5kg baby , how it will fit to an 8 kg"
Perfect product for kids upto 3 years.
"Low price, saved my money"
Best Quality
Best
This time I got this product of poor absorption quality. Frequently leaking. How could the same company produces different quality products in different lots?Is it fake?
Poor quality which I received.

It’s quite a nice product and a must have for parents.
Recently I buy the Pampers XL but the quality is very poor. After ware the diaper pant with in 2 hours it's leaked. Not 1 or 2 pants. So many pants  happen like this

Diaper
Good deal but can give some more discount for regular purchasers.
For baby it's urgent need.
"Wearing it at night and sleeping is not easy, it gets leaked in the morning."
There is no previous quality and the diaper is so thin.
Because of poor quality baby getting rashes.

Cheating

"Dear Sir,"
This time the feedback is just pathetic. Very poor quality. Kindly refund my money & take it back. Each & every Diaper is having a leakage issue.

Superb product.

Within two hours the diaper starts leaking which is disturbing my kid. Mamy poko was far better than pampers
My kid experienced rashes because of these aloveera Diapers and it smells full day. Now i am using Himalaya Diapers for him and he recovered.
Awesome product.
The product was an original one and was quite a cheap buy than what I usually get in retail stores
everything allright . too long delivery time
Am using pampers for my lol when she was 2months old...love the softness...til now no leaks....easily it last fo 4to5 hrs...she sleep vry comfortable n night..
"Veey worst quality, leakage in 4hrs and hard to use. While wearing it got tore. Tham mamy poko pants i use it is easy to wear and no leakage problem till 9hrs."
fake product.very poor quality.not working even for 4 hours.leaking from sides.very disappointed. Amazon should refund for these type of cheap quality product.
It's duplicate. It becomes full in 1 hour. Not absorbing properly. Worst
Good product
Leaking within minutes. This pack is not good.
Worst product.....seems the product is duplicate.....and material quality is worst diapers are not worth a penny......used 10 diapers till now and 8 of them leaked
Very good for baby skin I always use it for my baby.never faced any leakage problem in it. It is very durable and easy to use I always recommend it to others.
ok
Badiya
Product was not as per description. Package was leaked and product is deteriorated.
Nice
Four stars because I have received the pack which already opened and some diapers are stained
The quality is good and comfort for my kid no rash and leakage issues she has good sleep at night. while traveling and parents can be free and enjoy parenting.
The quality of the product still has to be improved.
Very good quality
Not good for my baby...
"The pampers new diaper is so good and the baby have no effect just like raises, etching and etc . The product is most comfortable and easy to wear kid."

I think duplicate product u sent
Up to 6 hrs it's ok. After that leaks
very low quality material. The same pack from the retail shop is different. Those pants have more thickness and durability. But this one is very thin.
We use pampers for baby daily and have found it to be suitable for baby.
Worth it
Good for baby
Awesome product
good
Pampers are leaking from side and material is very cheap I am using huggies from last 2 years dey r very nice and leakproof
Good
Its always a 5 star for me wen its Pampers..
One pant lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Depends on the baby. Good u can say
Very Bad product. It Soaks inside.. Not Leak proof at all.. Purchase it if you want your baby to suffer from cold. Soaking capacity is terribly bad..
"Awesome quality of diapers. Using the same for my kid since 1year, it is good and comfortable for babies. It's hassle free to use. Highly recommend it to all."
Move to pamper from mamy poko as paper is much better better as compare to others...Awesome product... My baby and I is very happy to use it...thanku pamper..
My products is not perfect I'm not satisfied.
"You send me wrong size pampers I order medium size , you delivered me small size pampers..."
  Thankyou
"We believed very much this product for my baby. Pampers with its softness, obserbency and leak proof Ness,  Baby very enjoying, freely moving and playing....."
Worst quality materials look like old stock all the diapers are smaller than medium size look like extra small. There is no 0 star othervies I will rated as 0
Value for money. But Amazon should look to make more discount.
Good product
Gud products

Top quality product...fully leaked proof n fabric is also soft
pampers is my fev brand for my 3yr baby.i always use pamper.its a good product.
Best as compared to all others
Value for money
The best diaper pants in the market love it very much worth every penny
"The new model with air channels are the worst pamper ever made. It leaks, always and fills very fast. Old model was much much better. Never buying this again."
Nothing dislike about
Nice product
Very good product and I am satisfied
Good product
Goof
Not recommend it's size also too small not for 4-8 kgs.its only less than 4 kgs children recommend.
Need 2~3 diapers every night for my baby. Urine overflowing in every 2hours. Huggies much better option.
Item was very poor in quality. Diapers got leak within 2 hrs. Worst experience look like amazon is also trying to fool customers by delivering  poor quality on standard items.
I think we r receiving defective material last two times. We change the brand for now
Don't buy this product Very poor quality
All good
Good
Ok
Good as usual
Not good
Nice
Like the product completely.... Worth the money.. Gives my  baby complete protection and freeness. No diaper rash till now compared to other brand...
Always gud
Pampers diaper is very softness instead of others.  It is abosuley leak proof.  It's smells good than other diapers. It's keeps baby's skin soft(rash proof).
Soft n leakproof....reasonable...adsorbs...
I ordering from past 2yrs from amazon for my son but in last 2 packets that i received there is lots of leakage issue....
Xl size is smaller than other brands
Good
Every thing is good
Rashes coming for my kid due to this pampers
Pampers is always my favourite
Good Quality diapers with lon lasting absorption and smooth to skin.. I regularly buy pampers for my child.. Happy with this order
Nice product
Need to improvise leaking.
Good
The quality is far better from other famous diapers.Its long lasting with a light smell. I always use pampers for my 8 months old baby and would surely recommend it.
Nice.... Thanks
I like this product. But this month not come Iam checked subscribe details product has returned why? I need this product I'm conform 100% Iam not returned this product

Worth money
Good quality nice fitting
Very good and leak proof product
I have been using pampers for my kid. Never faced any issue with it. I always buy from cloudtail and quality of the product is always good.
My child got infected. I thing the package was damage or expired item repacked. We thrown it away.
Awesome discount. Without going anywhere u could find the item
Nice
New produce is not good
Material quality is poor and durability is less and it is easy to use.
My baby be confortable with pampers.
The pampers received are of very poor quality. The exchange was rejected as I had (off course) opened the package.
This is very good product for my baby very soft I am using this product last 8 month
Every time I ordered pampers.. Got good use butThis time Very delicate while wearing to my kid.. There are tearing easily so wasted so many diapers
Its a good product. My baby feel good when she's wear pamper pant.
I like pamper pants for my baby....it's  not heavy as look wise and very soft.... And got package pre fromdelivery date thank you  amazon.
I am using this for my baby for last 5 months and really it is an excellent product.
"Sometimes getting leaked , but overall Good product"
This is really an amazing  product. My baby is happy and comfortable with this. The softness of this product is admirable. The quality is also good
Its an amazing product and i have purchase this for my nephew as my bhabhi is a perfect mother and she has perfect choice and my nephew feel so happy becuase pamper give him best pamper
No more damages
Pampers Diapers pants are very soft and the quality is also good. Liked the product. Best for overnight use.
The diaper does not seem to be original product as it is as the fitting issue and also the leakage issue.
Good product
Not sure whether it is original or not. If it is original then the quality is degraded. The quality is very bad. Not recommended.
"New design with Aloe vera and Gel, flexible band give my baby comfort, packing was good, overall good product for small babies"
Go for it
Very good
For my baby..I trust only Pampers..  its absorbency is wonderful. Nothing else like Pampers.
"Very nice product,my baby is happy with this.not any problem in this product.."
Very wast of product the product one hour pampers pants is full of productand normal pampers one day full also it could not come outside
We like ❤ this product due to its durability and water absoprtion capacity than any other diaers.  As well as in cost comparison.

Pampers are the best
Easy to use n quality is also good
I will suggest to buy this product
Very comfortable for my 2 year old son. The best in competition. Highly recommended.
Have been using it for my son for last 3 years. It does it's job.
Best product in the category...
Pampers diaper is no 1 diaper for baby. Pampers pants easy to use. And no leakeg. I m very satisfied with pampers for baby. And no rashes problems.
Good
They have kept price same and downgraded the product quality
"This is probably duplicate item, very thin and light like tissue, leaks , poor quality."
"Seller is fraud, and cheat."
Its stays very dry even if its absorpancy is very high.
Pampers are best compared to other diapers. I have been using them for my kids. Only problem is one in 10 diapers have a leakage problem. No rashes problem
Worst diaper .In half n hour it's leaked and I have to check regularly if you missed then bingo enjoy the wet bed . Biggest mistake to buy pampers
"My baby is getting rashes using this product, and also it has leakage problems. earlier I was using mamy poko pants which is far better than this."
Diapers leaked evry time i used it
Good
Original Product..!!
Original product
Price is more than market
"It is a very great product. Material is also soft so no rashes and no tension too. They have excellent quality, far superior to others available in market."
"This pampers is very bad quality, it doesnot absorb for 12 hours, it leaks everytime. May be it's not like another pampers quality, i dont recommend at all"
Ok
"From soften to absorbency, it has been best for baby. From birth to till age 4, used only pamper. Long lasting.."
"Leakage problem, my child wear it @10-11pm and at the morning time it will be leak, so please don't buy it again... Very bad quality"
Using pampers from day 1 for my son. No issues till now. Always bought pampers from Amazon. Great deals.
Good
Nice
Not the best but good one
"First day itself it leaked ,I had to change it 3 times in the night...First time it happened like this before diapers where good"
Worst product ever. i never expected this from Pampers.
not good in 2 hours it will get leaked.
Shame on this product.
It is a great product..material is soft sp no rushes after use..the best part is it alsp contains aloe vera...lova the product..
The diapers all leaked in one susu and seemed to be a fake. Have shifted to Mamy poko pants.
Please dont buy pampers.

"very good...soft, and has a very good smell, better than huggies"
Its very less quality product..and leakage rate is also high..buy not 128 nos ... buy only less than 70 nos package..product quality is different
Price is higher than big bazar
OK
When I opened up into our home small sizes in their bundle... Really I was disappointed. That's not right sized. we're ordered L (large) but in the bundle S size.
"The diapers were torn, had noticed in 8 pieces as of now rest is packed.  The quality is very light and as soon as you open it the outer cover gets out from all sides."
"LAST TIME WHEN I GOT THIS PRODUCT, THE QUALITY WAS GOOD, BUT THIS TIME (ON 11/03/2019) I GOT, THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT IS TOO BAD COMPARE TO LAST TIME."
"Hello Team,"
Pampers monthly box pack is not good. I request to exchange the product. We used only 5 diapers pants. Please check and do needful.
The product quality is very ordinary. It cannot be used for 1 night.
Mammy poko pant is better than Pampers pants.
Good
Waste of money

Ok
Good product
It's of very low quality.. leaks in two or 3 hours.. you can easily feel the tickness of diapers.. it looks like duplicate product...
"Hi, toddlers"
It's very easy to wear and remove.
"Nicely observes the wetness, no rashes"
Baby will be Happy
Amazon Cheat me. Medium size m small size de rahe h ye... Medium size order kiye to medium size me small size de rahe h...
PLZ DO NOT BUY...wish there was negative marking scheme for this product...it is a substandard product...waste of money...regret having bought one from Amazon.
"Good, can purchase for your child. Safe for baby skin. No rashes. Amazon delivery excellent. Usable hours 9-10 max after that spillover happens."
Pampers pant always are the wonderful product for babies.. Leak proof pant...Product was nicely packed..thanks amazon...
Very good material
Nice product from pampers..really its value for money....
"Leak proof, eco- friendly...its suits my baby 100%......"
Thanks pampers and amazon!!!
Do not order from Amazon. I made a mistake with size and they refuse to even change the size. Not sure what I should do with over 100 undersized diapers.
Very very poor napkin. Very much disappointed. It's like plastic paper. No leakage proof and absorbency. I'm buying it every month and subscribed for it.
"Not a genuine product. Started leaking in just one use. Not sure why Amazon is entertaining such duplicate products. Not able to return , waste of money."
Very low quality.i ordered the same product many times from Amazon but this time product quality is low.liw absorbency and leaking frequent.softness is satisfactory
"Super Product...Best in Quality, Excellent absorbency..Baby Feel highly comfortable, soft & no issue of rashes.......Value for Money..."
Really comfortable and keeps my baby nice & dry. Love the softness & mild elastic which does not leave a mark.
good product all mothers should go for it...light weight ....and has amazing odour that comes from each diaper
Good
Very good product
Good product and fast delivery.
Not really good
Good quality to use ..always pamper is the best product.
Sometimes Raches occurred
Overall a good product.
The product material is very poor. Cant use it properly.  I am not satisfied with this product.  The product material in  real is very different.
Long lasting and comfortable for my baby girl. We mostly use it during travelling. Haven't had any porblems. Always recommend.
Best quality in the world thanks to amazons help to product is coming to my home all the best team
I am ordering this product regularly but since last 2 time getting worse product.. getting doubt.. is it real pamper or duplicate.. really dissatisfied..

Good product because of magic gel nice smell and absorption value for money
"Is this an original product?? It doesn't even have capability of 2hrs, not absorbing at all. Worst"
Amazon are you guys really selling original product??
Good
"Best Dipers for my child, using since past 2 years"
Good one
ITS BEST
Ok
My baby feels comfortable....it absorbs completely...and he didn't get rashes...it is so smooth so that he won't feel uncomfortable after waring it
So so
"Never expected such product from papmers. Absorption is very bad, it remains dry for less than an hour. Pamper should work on absorption quality."
Very Bad quality. Rashes appears due to this pack. Have used pampers before but this one is waste...
Leaks early even for new borns.may b gel content is less that's the reason
Pamper is the best diaper but the new one is quite less in quality...The previous quality was better than this..Plzz improve your quality again.. Thanks
pampers are the best brand for babies ....this diapers are really good and my baby feels really comfortable in this product
It's spoliing my baby's skin.. usage of this product rashes....Not recommendable.
In almost every nappy there was leakage
Full loss
Please dont buy pampers
I have shifted to huggies and mamy poko pants
These diapers are GREAT! They're super cute and they are made of high quality materials. Definitely worth the price and I would buy them again.
Genuine product and timely delivery
I happy this pampers
It's very good and high quality product.
Keeps my baby dry and happy.
Thanks Pampers
"If I talk about its softness,absorbency, I would rate it beyond 5 stars. Price were also good."

I think they sending a fake product. Material is really bad quality. Only last for a few hours.. don't buy this one. They are cheating
The product and the quality is absolutely fine but it got delivered to another house within the same building

Sleep peacefully at night
"its tight for what size they have recommended baby weight, and diaper is not at all leakproof it will start leaking in a hour"
Atleast 1 pant should be stand upto 12 hours. 8 hours is not enough for one night. Except this material and all are too good.
"great quality, keeps the baby dry for a long time. Pampers is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of diapers"
Good
Easy to use!
Good
Better than other brands of Diapers in the Market....Once you use this product you will see a remarkable difference .
5 stars
Good ... Go for it.

"baby got rashes with this new product of pampers , not recommended"

Nice
I don't understand how pampers could make such useless diapers....it's leaking all the time... complete waste of money...so unhappy with the product...
V disappointed wit d product as it leaks on side n doesn't last longer as its displayed. Compared to other products of pampers this is highly pathetic.
Good
Gives immense diaper rash. Not good material quality.
Good  Quality
Very bad product. Material is cheap synthetic. Durability is badly short. Bought buggies n mummy poko pant several time.bt pamper is unworthy.
ye diaper itna patla he ki baby ki ak baar ki susu me hi our ho raha he.
Very good for children so happy
Wonderful diapers by pampers
"These pampers diapers are skin friendly, leak proof and rash free.Feels comfortable and light compared to other diapers. A must buy product for babies."
"I am using this product of pamper since my twins were born...very comfortable, soft,rash free & easy to use...so m completely satisfied for my twins..."
Must try for your baby
it's smell is not good...after 10 to 15 minutes of use its smells too much..before this I purchased this product from first cry and I'm not facing this problem
These are very good forur baby n when compared to mamy  pokopants these are light weight with good absorbency .it is a 5 star product
I like it youse my baby
Size is small. I want to return but there is no return option for this please help me..
It gives nappy rash
So nice products no harmful
This a softness and absorb no leak
My best choice be happy every think my baby
great product
Good
Absorbency is nice but works up to 6 hours then it can't be used more than that
The product is good and reliable.
new versions is not that good compare to old one....its leaking in every 3 to 4 hr...in night we need wakeup andchange it cin mid of the night...
Good product
"Dipper is good but baby will always laying down wet abservation should there back side little extra,"
"I have been using Pampers for my baby from his 1st month, most of the packs I bought from Amazon and all are good till date."
These are the best diapers i have used.. no leakage. My baby sleeps peacefully the whole night.. these diapers are the best.
Good quality
Nice product

I have been using Pampers from 4 years for 2 of my children...and they seems best in quality when compared to other brands... thanks pamper for making our life easy.
Not bad not good
I ve been using this for my son since two years...
Good
Diaper looks cheap not very good quality..the one i buy from shop looks better quality..even though it's large size bit tight for my 7months 9kg baby.
Good one
Regular customer of this product... First time it Doesn't seems original...  Low Quality...  The worst thing is not eligible for replacement or return
Very worst. Have taken multiple times the same product but this time very worst and not worthy of money. For Below one year kid also not feasible size
We are extremely disappointed with the quality and softness. Leakage is also added feather. Kindly review the product qualifies for marketing.
Nice
Definitely not worth buying as it leaks all the time. Try mamy extra absorb
"Very poor quality, i think duplicate product"
"After using all diaper brands, I zeroed in on pampers.. it's the best in business .. baby stays dry for three active hours."
"Not a good product, quality issue"
Good
"It's really one among the best diapers, I have ever used. No leakage. Soft and remains dry over night. My son sleeping good and me too... Thanks to Pampers"
Duplicate product same brand same size I purchase from market the absorbency level is quite DIFFRENT
"The Pampers was open when I received and not sure if it was used by anyone,so hoping for refund as return policy says I can't return"
"Good product,been a subscriber since last year."
Thumbs up
The daipers leaks when a little pressure is applied. This happens when the baby sleeps at night on one side
Not up to mark.. leakage issue with maximum pieces and quality not looks okay.  It looks duplicated product
It smells like the scented stationery we get for kids. I’ve been using pampers for 5 years now and this is a first.
nice one
Very good..
Veey comfortable to use
Nice n economic combo pack
Fake product! The quality is not good! Leaks in few hours
I thing it is not a genuine pack..it's a duplicate material as I have used the original one.
Good products
Good
"Best and cheap ,thanks amazon"
Cloudtail India is selling duplicate products. This diaper is not lasting even couple of hours. Shameful how even infants products are sold duplicate.
Could have been little cheaper...
Good one
These new Pampers diapers are waste. Do not buy. Earlier product s were good.
Nice smell..very soft inside
It's give my baby full day to enjoy herself wat she loves to do as it's softness doesn't irritating her. N myself tension free bcoz it is leak proof.
Good product
It must be fake or pampers is using bad quality material my baby is getting rashes every time he is wearing it
Good but not so
Best diapers..Bht hi acche h
Fills up within 2 piss
"Amazing Absorbent My Baby like it I don't prefer diaper but it is necessary when we travel, so pampers is a best choice no rashes no leakage"
The product is quite old.
Also the product packet was already open while it was delivered.
Want to return the product.
"Good diapers , No rashes . Thanks"
Gud
In large pack pamper has compromised the quality. Even doesn't look originals like ordered previously. Have to change this diaper in every 2-3 hours.
Nice product nd value for money
Quality differs from what I was getting. Seems like we got the duplicate product
Quality bestowed in pampers
"Guys can you please take this product back, my baby having rashes"

"I buy pampers regularly for my kid. But this time, the quality was so poor and felt like it’s a duplicate product."
Mammy poko pants is far better then this one.  I dont know whether it is original or not but quality is very poor.
"Dislike this item, not durable enough for 2 hours... It becomes leaked after 2 hours.... All clothes are wet..... Nothing like that product anymore..... Not want to buy any more..... Waste of money"
Very good product for Baby
Easy to use. Best brand in the market. No leakage of any kind. Not require to see for a whole day
This is not medium size this is very small . I regularly used m size but dis tym an issue with size... Not actually perfect m size what can I do my money is waste
Pampers are the best diapers for babies.

Comfortable for babies
This product Is gentle soft for my baby skin and good absorbency without any leakage problems. This is very nice product for my baby sleep.
Pampers is apt  when it comes for peaceful sleep of both your child as well as yours.  Being soft and leak proof it is best for your child.
Should try another variant. These pants are leaking after very short time. First time within 3 year experiencing this problem with pampers.
I have been ordering the same product multiple times. Somehow the set that I got this time is completely unsatisfactory. The absorbency is pathetic.
Poor quality. I never expect this from pampers brand. It got leakage within 2 hours. I bought this product in offer of 80+ pieces.. i totally worst.
I wanted to order premium pants but by mistake in urgency i had ordered these dry pants but why aren't these eligible for exchange?
Pampers are very good.... Material is also good
Worth buying...
Nice diaper brand and delivery support from Amazon is awesome...
Good
"Duplicate material received, diapers leaking"
"I have been using pampers for my baby since she was born, they are very comfortable to wear, rash free and provide good absorbency"

Thanks!!!
Awesome product with reasonable price. Thanks Amazon.
"Quality of this product is very poor,Earlier when i bought the pamper brand diaper is of good quality. Not to buy this mega monthly save box."
Good
Amazon always rocks for me. Best product delivered.
Not satisfied as the odour is very strong and not recommended for babies.
I love the pampers. They are really comfortable for my kids . Specially in night time. I am using this from thier birth . So i wil suggest it to every parent.
Very Good Product.
"Pampers diapers are very soft, leak proof with high absorbency capacity.."
Using for my child every day..
Super product ..
Must buy...
"My baby didn't like it, don't know why he refuses to wear it, he likes momypoko pants"
Good
As per expectations
Nothing
Must buy for babys
Good but not so good as we bought from outside very thin inside and not match the quality
It's very smooth for baby skin and I m very happy.
Using Pampers Since Child Born. No Problems Faced Till Now. Where Ever We Goes Our Backpack Contains 1 Count Diaper Pant 😄
It's the best diapers for us comparing to other company/brand....
Using it for a long time and satisfied with the product very much. Thank You.
This pamper diapers i think is duplicate.that is not original ever time leage problem.i am not happy with this product 🙁

Nice product
"As per my wife opinion, till the time pamper pant is best"
Quality of product is completely changed. It's has became worst product now. Very thin and doesn't absorb and started liking quickly
Compared to other products I feel Pampers is the best product.very soft and leak proof.i suggest Al mummies to prefer Pampers as ur first choice..
It's not original product. The material is not good. Leakage is a big problem and so is absobency. The within 4 hours it's starts to leak
Very bad quality and I think this is the third grade product. Would never buy diapers from Amazon again. Very disappointment it is like a thin sheet.
Worst one and it's not original product.
Good product
Best diapers in the market
Good ones. Have bn using them since my baby's birth & it has hardly failed me.
"Genuine product at right price, go for it"
Wetter
What could be better if not pampers . One of the best baby brand. Time saver for working/housewife moms. Kudos to pamper diapers
Very disappointing couple of problems observed.
Not evenly absorbed
Leaking problem
Few diapers 2-3 found damaged
good
"This diaper is not the same as Pampers large bought prior to this. The diaper is thinner due to which leakages are more. Also, it tears off easily"
Liked the product
V good
Got at very less price comparably
Best
Value for money
Leakage problem is so disturbing experience with this product.
Absorbing capacity is much more than other diapers. It doesn’t leak even after wearing it for a very long time.
Good quality products with no leakage problem and very easy to use. Must buy if you are looking to buy diapers.
Awesome..
Waste of money. It cannot absorb and it's not a leak proof. -1 star. And there will be no return policy
"Seems to be fake product, if not also don't go for it. Mamy poko is the best."
"I have been ordering pampers, but first time looks like I received a fake product"
The quality was not good and microfibres started coming out
Good
"Last year they have changed product pattern, old one was much better in all forms"
The size is a little small than the pampers xl 58 count.
Good
Am regular buyer for my baby. It's very good product. Cause no rash to baby.  Have no Leakage problem. Timely delivery.
Very poor quality. Pls don't go for it .. Good only for 2 hrs. After that either it will leak or baby will be in wet...

Very bad quality and it’s leaking like anything..never expected this quality of product from amazon! I want refund or replacements of the product
"I have ordered this for my baby earlier also from Amazon but this time the product looks very cheap,"
And it's leaking from the sides as well
Got v substandard Pampers diapers this time..it gets leak within few hours of use...I'm very much disappointed .. won't buy again from Amazon....

👎
It's number one diaper so I like so much...
Pampers are good...Stays long...
"burst quality, after baby's first urine it smells very bad."
dont buy .... mamy poko is very nice.
Not at all a good quality product
Product is OK but not suitable for whole night
"Dipers dont have good absorbancy,  nither it's leakproof each day the diper leaks,  ya it's soft no issues...."
"Its value for money, when bought from Amazon."
It is vry use to use it and it is very best material and not havy to feel uncomfortable for ur child. I recommend you all to purchase it
"they are not durable, very thin material & diaper gets fluffy in very short time. doesn't last for 6-7 hours in night."
Quality is very very bad it is tearing out If baby is in sleep also what a worst quality guys are providing customers.
The gel one used to be perfect but the new air is so so airy that it keeps very less inside and leaks most of the time
Good products
Very low quality.. cant use for overnight.. material is not worth.. disappointed with pampers!! Will give a second thought before next purchase.
Owsom quality
While the product is great I am seeing a constant decline in the retention qty over recent months.
Not happy with this product.
Okay
Product is very nice but the cost is too high compare then others
"Ordered in bulk quantities, after opening packets found the diapers are too thin and can't absorb even one time urine, seems these are duplicate"
"Wrongly ordered, it is not a good product. Always give rashes and can't keep it for long."
"Good, but also try to keep fruit bun of Bonn company and 100% Atta bread of English Oven (with yellow colour packaging"
Excellent quality..

Best product in its category.  Great absorption capacity.  Its material is baby skin friendly. I strongly recommend everyone..
Awesome diapers. It's leak proof and very soft which is very good for your baby. It smells is also good. And it is absorbency.

It is not 100% leak proof.
Quality of the product not up to the mark. I think it is some look alike product made by some one not pampers

Good Product
Does not seem an original one.
Moreover no return policy...Wish I could see the policy before...Do not fall pray with this diaper.A Big NO
Then packet of diaper we received this time is of qualitywise very low. Seems like they have provided medium sized diapers in xl size diaper s.
Perfect product for infants.
No leakage issues and really easy to use
No complaints
If you buy a branded product online you dont need to write any review. The name say all of it
Ok
"The diapers are not original as of pampers,  got leaked even in 2 hours.  Totally waste of money, don't buy from this fraud seller"
Its worth less product compare to other diapers..... Just waste of money. It will not absorb long time.....  It lasts within 3-4 hours
Now price is high
Thanks Pampers for the comfort and best diaper. I am using for my 3months baby. Totally satisfied.
Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
Diapers are very durable and can be used atleast 10 times after washing.. No matter it is pissed or pooped...😮😂😅😹🙈🙉🙊💩
The product quality had gone down drastically. The Air diapers are very low quality and tear apart easily. Cancelling the subscription
This pampers in not the original product
This pampers is leaking Often
Worst product
Worthless
Plz don't show products like this
The product is good as compared to other brands..as it absorbs very well baby likes it.. you can purchase without any doubt..
Good as mentioned. Shopkeepers are looting. Enjoy great discounts on Amazon with good quality products. Thumbs up Amazon!!!!;
Pampers always best....
Best
Love it
Nothing
"Good product, good offer"
Nice brand.
Very dry.
Must be used by everyone. My son is 1.5 years old and i am using pampers since his birth and its value worth using it.
"Very Good Quality product. It helps baby to sleep peacefully overnight, rashefree  and also helps in travelling. Thnx Pampers"

This item with 76 count looks like a first copy of original pampers or may be the company has lowered it's standard of product. Baby got rashes while using this. This pack not suggested.

Recently i received this product for my nephew it's have a great softness friendly with skin fully leak proof in short value for money product

Good quality product
Genuine quality at an affordable price
Product is good and cheap as compare to other vendor

Product is as good as I expected. Also rate is very satisfied than other mega store. Packing is too good and the wrap tape is also adjustable.
Very bad products. It leak every time. Earlier Pampers 3 layers absorbtion was better than this new Air channels.I will never order this new Air channels.
Nice

Every day in morning it leaks and child pants and beds are fully wet. Very horribly and disappointed. I regularly order this thing from amazon
Good
"The size is not XL. It’s too small. Not satisfied with the size. XL is printed on the pamper, but its not exact XL size."
It is very soft and good comparing to others as I used other brands also but they caused rashes.
But no such issue with these diapers...
"Worst pampers ever bought,first time i am buying pampers from amazon and it is the worst it leaks very much  it doesnt absorb anything at all"
Pampers has always been my favourite .. does not cause rashes ..soft on skin and definitely great absorbency .. totally the best diaper brand
Verry good product for baby. It also protect baby from likeage
Wonderful

Helps my baby sleep in peace.

Some times leaking

"The package was economical. The product is extremely reliable, very absorbant for long hours"
When I am making my son wear the diapers they are tearing from the side when I am slightly stretching them. Never expected that from Pampers!
Value for money
Good day I trust you have any other information in the future
Absorbing is not good leaks with in one hour.
Quality is very low
Good
Good product and promt delivery by amazon.
Huggies is better than this.
Great product and delivery was too good.
Overall very good leaking is very less using over night very comfortable for my baby
"ths best part of ths diaper is that it is thin but absorb quality is super compare to other brand, its gud diaper at affordable  price"
We are using Pampers right from the Baby's month 1 and we feel it is the best  and easy to use which gives comfort to baby.
Pampers are the love of parents who don't want to compromise their baby's care.
Always the best.. Will remain the choice forever...
Some of them bad

Thanks a loy to Pampers..
Waste of money.
Good priduc
Tried this air channel diapers on my son. These are leaky. The regular non-air channel ones are way better

No size matter there only length long in size hate it
"Easy to use, high absorbent power"
"Nice product for babies compare to other diapers, I have never faced any leakage with this product"
Best for your baby
Its a fake product. There is no batch number mentioned on the diapers and quality is not matching with Pamper diapers which we are using till now.
itsa good one but looks like the absorbing capacity is low.but does the work
This product is not genuine. It starts leaking within 2 hours. Pathetic and duplicate product
Good
Love it
Satisfied with product. Good packing.
Good
Quality okay.but getting full in only 3-4 time urination.
I bought it for my new born nephew. Diaper was pretty good in quality. I got this product during Independence day sale for a very low price.
"Iam using pampers from last 4 years for both of my children , these are very soft , comfortable n leak proof, I suggest people to use these."
"Product quality  is very bad, its just a brand name. Not at all recommend to anyone. Will leak very soon and very unhealthy for small baby's"
Amazing diapers.. they are really super soft and absorb pee all night.. really happy using pampers and also they r easy to wear for the baby
Some of diapers are defective leaking from sides due to loose elastic
Don't know where to complaint either amazon or pampers ....
Great product.  Keep baby dry throughout night
It's amazing diaper no 1 daiper

"Cheap Product, Waste of Money. Mamy Poko is Very Good Product compared to Pampers."
It's getting too costly every month. I started purchasing Large 64 numbers from Rs 600 and it went to somewhere 780 now in just 5-6 months.
Very comfortable diapers for my baby with good absorbency. Can use for long as we go on trip. Leak proof and flexible as well.
Thanks.
Nice
depends on how many times baby urinate.but fibers are comes out if baby wears it more than 6 hours
Pampers best for babies they understand what babies need
Well
very dispointed I was fan of pamper diaper style but after this I will not recommend any one to buy pant style.everytime is leaked
Must go best in the market in comparison to other brands ...5star for this product
Nice because trusted brand
Very nice product. Compare with others material is soft. Product is easy to use.
Material quality not at all good.. Should be softer... Baby doesn't feel comfortable in it
Too cost
It's a very good product... But at nights it sometimes leaks and spread to front dress...

Great product. My baby girl sleeps soundly when she's wearing it. Much better than other brands.
Great durability and easy to wear
"This product is poor, this is used for single use, if baby  urinate twice it's overflowing, every night we need to change thrice."
Good
Very nice...My baby is always happy by wearing papers.It is very soft . It has good absorbency capacity.It also very light and leak proof.
Such a good shape and healthy for children.  This diaper  have some super absorbency and it runs for max 12 hours . Good product for baby.
I like pampers diapers..i m using this from starting.. amazing absorbent... Its very soft no rashes no leakage
Very happy to use this
Leaking problem in night...it has less then 7 hours of durability.
Huggies and Mamy poko pant is better than this.
Thanks.
Quality is good in compared to other products in market.
It didn't have extra absorber......So it's capacity is week.....Pampers have extra absorber ....We can use one or two pampers in a day....Now we are using 3 to 5 pampers daily....
Very nice product
Better than other diapers...need to more improvement on leak proof and absorbency
Original diapers discounted price
I can see the difference in the quality of the product. It is thinner and doesn't last for more then an hour
"Yes it's ok, make it more leak-proof."
"And one more thing every month We ordered pamper monthly pack, try to give us discount"
"After reading reviews, I was in doubt that the product may not be as it's reputation. But I didn't found anything wrong and dicy."
"It's so soft and comfortable for the baby , doesn't give any rash ...my baby sleeps undisturbed the entire night"
Nice
Diapers are very good in quality.. leak proof and good absorbent so baby doesn't gets rash even using same diaper for whole night..

It's very worse product. First time I got this kind of product it is leaky and very thin. Almost like a butter paper nearly to its end.
Pampers are the best
"These diapers do not work for too long and do not work for whole night, the absorbency is not good, please don’t buy"
I purchased it for Rs.1284 on an offer. the product is quite satisfactory.
Ok

It is very soft and fits perfectly. No leak. Keeps the baby dry. My son loves it and he usually plays with the unused diapers
The product quality was very bad. Even other low rate brands have better quality. Is it a Duplicate product?
No good as it's much thinner and smaller than the same product selling in the retail stores.

Tried every songle company who provides diapers but found pampers the best abd here in good deal also

This is a fake product so thin that it gets leaked immediately. Not a genuine product i want to return this. Please tell the process.
Ordered for my niece and my sister is using this since the day she was born and she praises it a lot as it's very comfy and leak free
From the day I purchased it..its leaking everyday..I m planning to buy from store and see if there and see if there is any difference
Third class product.. it is getting leaked from sides... this has never happened... i think the product is fake and not upto the mark
Fine quality
"Product is not bad, But takes 17 days to reach it to my hand"
Vary good quality with excellent durability thanks for such a nice product.
It is a very good choice  for my baby.It give him very comfort.it is highly  leak proof and give more time for sleep
quality is good...
Great brand with great comfort to both kid/parents
"Totally waste product, first Cry experience and products are better. It seems to be a fake product."
"Very good quality..like it..pampers r best..they leakproof,abosrbency time are more than 10 hours.."
"Using material cheap for offer packs,"
Pampers is best but don't buy offer packs.
I had been using pampers diaper pants S size for months ...It's very easy to use and my child is having a good sound sleep .
"Lack of abortion, less soft, not original quality. When I buy pampers from the market I realize the difference, poor quality"
Worse product ever seen
"Product is very good at quality , absorbency really helps while traveling with baby. It is 100% leak proof."
It leaks. The one that I received is a faulty product. It leaks a lot....
To b frank I won't buy it again.
Sahi h bhai
Good pampers for my baby
And light weight pampers with fantastic packing thanks amazon
Recived duplicate product pls Amazon check d quality it's a request we r using fore kids nl
"Excellent product , material quality is osm n it is fine n easy to use. A very good product"
Value for money
I don't know y the size has been reduced for the product compare to last month also this time they introduce new option with AIR  channels. I don't like this product
Value for money
Diaper can only hold for 4-5 urination. Only last for 4-5 hrs.
Good product
Very poor quality
Original
Excellent daipers for new born who have not started to turn around or crawl.
I like this product for my little one
Good product. Only good offer should be there
Value for money
My baby has got rashes. I think the product I've got is duplicate and the item is not refundable. Waste of money.
Plz amazon make a replacement.

Nice
Easy to use.
Best in all diapers
Good product and effective and fast delivery
Recieved what I expected....good one
Extra absorb channels - that model was good compared to this. This quality is not good. It cannot absorb much. Need to change every 3-4 hours..
Soaking capacity is low than Huggies.
These are NOT ORIGINAL THEY ARE FAKE .PAMPERS SIZE IS SMALL AND PAMPERS IS NOT PRINTED ON IT .DO NOT BUY IT
Best product.
Very Nice Pampers... Really Very much Soft & baby feel comfortable too. And it's 💯% Leak proof. Value For money & must buy for your babies!
The best in comparison to other brands.
"I love this product...have been using it from day one...absolutely leak free, long lasting, soft and comfortable and my baby never had rashes"
Just okay. Not suitable for kids above 18 months.
The quality of pamper diaper is very poor... please don't buy from Amazon... Instead buy from shop
This time l received very poor quality diapers.. It is not same quality as I bought from market or received from Amazon previously..
Nice product
Am a second time purchase  this product. This time quality is very cheap. Leaking  problem is a main issue of this product.
It’s too thin to absorb no long lasting at all.
"Good material , good smell , lasts long"
Product was really good and on time delivery
Seems good
It's very Easy to use and soft and most important it's highly comfortable. I loved it. It worth it.
I am not satisfied with the product. The material quality of the product is very bad. Now this time I am dispointed with your product.
Good
Product was not good.
Good for baby child
The diaper pants are not 100% leak proof. These will score a little less compared to conventional diapers.
The pamper pants a good quality product its very comfortable and absorbed over night pèe very good product
it is very soft diaper as compared to the another diapers of the same brand. lekage proof and comfortable.
Have been using Pampers dry pants since my baby is born and i am totally satisfied with the material quality . No fear of rashes to the baby.

Leak proof and more handy then before
I never saw it's lasting 12hours as shown in add. But OK to use.
Love the performance of these diapers! The fit is good and they allow my baby to sleep all night without any leaks
This lot was leaking. Although I am regularly taking from Amazon only. But this supply didn't meet my expectation.
Nice ones to have for kids
Nice Good product

Material is different
Good ...it's ok
"Love it as it has a nice fragrance of aloe Vera, baby doesn't get Rashes and is comfortable even if my baby has to wear it for 24*7"
Material Quality is very poor as compared to same product in small quantity like 20 diaper pack.
Not recommended quality wise.
As expected
Good quality
Worst diaper available on Amazon. Not recommended for buying.
Nice
Awesome
I used it for my baby and trust me its worth every penny! Just crack the deal n but it on Amazon!

My baby has been using it from last six months and I find very convenient and easy to buy the same from Amazon
It's worth the price
Very low price than market

Very nice product. I have been using this for my kid from the beginning.  Genuine product
Very very bad product
".fully wrong fully worst product,I got today fully dissatisfied wd it.amazon going to cheating with us."
"Ordered and subcribed for pampers ""air"" Pants and was delivered pampers ""No. 1"". Irony is product can't be returned after delivery"
Please bring back the older version of extra absorbing channels of pampers it's a kind request stop this New version it's not good
Comfortable sleep of both baby n mom.
Good product quality and its easy to use and long lasting over night.
Very Good On Time Delivery
Diaper has to be changed within 2-3 hrs. soaking capacity is negligible. This is the worst new product launched by pamper
Good
Not satiesfied....leakage at mid night...worst product...amazon should check the quality...market product is best
Ok
My baby likes it. Amazon service is good.
Nice product
"Very thin,  not satisfied, quality is poor then small pack. Money wastage with such a big package order."
Using pampers for a long time and they r d best pant style diapers. Highly recommend to all
This is a very good product one should use this instead of trying other have used this for my kid from two and half years
It’s not original product.. worst one .. not good for baby’s soft skin ..I don’t have option to give zero star to product
If you can get the premium version of this get it instead but this is a little rough on the kids
Product is good..but it leaks. It's doesn't work whole night
Good
Good
I bought xl ..... but size seems smaller
I doubt if it's original .......
Internal colour is also slightly changed

Compare to previous pamper pants now a days these are with low quality and are getting full soon
Good...
Not satisfy at all. Facing lickage/ overflow issue within 3/4 hrs. Not expecting such product from pampers. Not recommended to anyone.
Nice
Diaper was very cheap it will filled with 2 times of baby unire discharge
"It's  a great product,"
Fits well and keeps dry upto 10 hr. It comes with soft material so baby is rash free
Looks like I was delivered a substandard fake set of pampers. It would disintegrate to bits on usage on my baby.
Good product fast delivery
Good
I prefer pampers
It's absorbing capacity is not so good. It Leaks during night. ...
Super
"New style pants are good, no leak and kids have a good time. I suggest to buy pamper"
NYC product

No words just thank u Pampers....
Poor
Good product

This is a fake product. Doesn't have aloe gel lock
"My baby got rash using this, i used the same from a store it was good. The dates n all were fine but it gave severe rash to baby."
Like the product. It's good for my baby as she can comfortably stay in it the whole day without getting diaper rashes or leakages
This product is not up to the mark as it should be. It should have more soaking power. It is also not very good to keep baby dry.
Excellent
Soft ...comfortable for baby
Good
Great product
"This product  is very good,safe and comfort  for my baby.It absorbency  is very good and it give comfort sleep ."
"Using this for 18 months from the birth of my baby. Tried Huggies, mamy poko. But nothing is better than pampers."

This diaper is good but sometimes is very poor types absorbency.
It's ok
That's easy to use for babey material also so nice durability also so relaxing
Pampers is always good but the older ones with extra absorbent channels were much better
Gffgfghbbb

This product seem like new design but the absorption quality is degraded. Every 2hr I have to change dipper. Previous design was very good in quality.
Experience very bad.. absorbing power is not up to mark.. leaking problem..  huggies is best..

Very-very bad quality.
This pamper is leaking very fast with in 2-3 hours it's got leaked.
Very poor quality. Not expected from co. Like pamper.
PAMPERS DIAPERS ARE THE BEST FOR BABIES SINCE MY BABY BORN I'M USING PAMPERS.

The pampers diapers is very much comfortable and it is very helpful and useful product my baby sleeps overnight happily

It is not worth. Waste of money. Not a good product. Can't return also. Leak in one two hours.
Have been using this product for my kid from past 2 years. Totally satisfied.
Horrible..the extra absorb channel ones are really good..this airchannels r pathetic
Its leaking. There is no use of having diapers or not. Except few diapers in the packet all are defective and useless
This product is very good and it is getting at a very cheap price. You must buy from Amazon as you have seen pictures

Sealed item should b returnable. Mistakenly order pants style instead of active baby.pant style doesn’t suit my baby
Pampers diaper is very good product.
 It is absolutely leak proof.
It is very soft and safe for baby skin.
"0% absorbency, it's wet everytime"
Leaks most of the time.
I would never recommend this product to any one.
Good
I don't think this is legit material because it gets heavy and leaks.
All the diapers are leaking. It does not have any cushion to absorb fluid. Local or duplicate diapers being sold at lower price.

This lot product is going leaks.

Was sceptical before I bought it as there were lots of mixed reviews but it turned out to be great.

No other diaper can beat pampers

Not like old pampers. These new ones are leaky and not at all reliable. Better to go for some other brand .
Product is okay and the deal at Amazon was the best one

"Product was not packed by Amazon, it was sealed by tape. And box was opened not covered. It's look very cheap at the time of delivery."
Better product for the baby's.
Pampers quality
Nothing to say as I m a regular purchaser..
Pamper is better than any other brand
Very good  nice fit for baby
"very useful,, pant type diapers"
"It's very comfortable for babies especially during travel..comparing with others,its absorbency s awsm nd my baby loves it.."
"I hv received the wrong product. Ordered for xl size but got size l. As this product is non returnable, it's a waste for me."
"not leak proof, it's not 7 to 12 kg . like small baby diaper , because using not well .very poor quality don't purchase that"
The design  needs to be reviewed . The stuff gets pushed to the back. When the child sits the stuff comes out from the back.
It's a duplicate product.  I'm surprised that a reputed online site like upurs sell duplicate products. Clearly disappointed
Good product

About 5% of products are damaged. Assured discounts never given.
"Diapers is too thin ,doesn't seem like original Pampers,  becomes full immediately"
Price is too much
I used this for my 10 months old baby and the quality is very poor as compared to the products used till date. These gets wet very fast.
Excellent product

This first time I ordered this brand and next time also I will order the same
Product is nice
Very good diaper and reliable for the absorption. Using the same brand since my daughter was born and completely satisfied.
You can't expect this wear for more then 3 hours..  It start leaking and the jell stuffed inside of this is of low quality.
It is good to use and very helpful tool to  parents for their babies ...both parents and baby feel happy and relax with it.
Very comfortable and soft diaper of pampers... I purchase Every month monthly mega box of pampers for my twins daughters...
Easy to use. Last all night. Comfortable for my son.
Need to work on ecofriendly material to make it disposable.
Go for it

Like a plastic pant. Feel wetness after only one time pee. Very bad
Very good quality

"The diaper is useful for my baby.I bought the product by very cheap rate than market,so it is best."
Good..
Vry vry vry bad experience...worst n duplicate product.i wud hv select no stars for this product bt no option 😡
The quality is worst at first I thought as per the season kids tend to pee a lot. However within half an hour checked my baby diaper was full. Had a subscription with the 68 pieces one however amazon doesn't have it anymore so changed it to this 64 pieces pack.  At first I was ok as the company is the same however had ordered this separately and am completely unhappy by buying this product. I change my baby diaper after every 6 hours however now I do it frequently and have stopped using it now and bought the other one from somewhere else the 68 pieces one for 535 rs. This is the first time  dissatisfied with pampers and amazon.
It's light weight & easy to use the material is thin can tear off easily
Absorb in 2-3 hours.  Do not use in long time
"Leakages, bad experiences"
Nice one
Nice
i like this because price is less tn market and brand pamper is beneficial for my baby.
Good
This time I received pampers which leaks after drops and the jell cAme out. Around 10 times of the whole Usuage.
Best in business
Product  quality is very good... My baby feel is comfortable while wearing too good  5-6 hours
"Heavy leakage in this diapers. Very bad product, don't buy this product"
Duplicate product. Request you to connect me. I have tried to post about adultared product but your team has deleted it.
"This is very bad quality, very thin and absorbing capacity is very low. very low material used. Do NOT buy this product."
Nice quality and good price so overall a gud buy.
Good
Quality is not good..  Leakage is there if used over night (even for less than 8 hours). Stopped buying
As per size L size pamper is too small and it will not last more than 2-3 hours
Good
Its one of the best diapers.
Tried all brands of diapers and foud Pampers to be the best out of them all. Fast timely delivery by Amazon.

Sometimes the diapers get leaked.

Pampers is always good.. Ahead of mamy poko pants
"Nice, go for y"
The product what I got was full of ants.. every single diaper became useless.
Sad that my return period s over..
Good product. Value for money. Got extra 10% discount under Amazon pay
Good
Does not last for more than 3-4 hours
"It's material quality is good, it will not cause any rashes"
The only thing that I don't like is it's duration (6-8 hours)

We have received pampers of very poor quality.pampers react with baby skin . please arrange to pick up packed packet.
I generally order diapers from amazon. They are genuine and good delivery time. Material quality and offers are good.
a happy baby is happy mom. pampers is undoubtedly most comfortable for babies and its worth buying from amazon deals.

Pampers i think is the best quality diaper. If it is cheaper i think most of the consumer we prefer it
"Bought many a things ... from Cloudtail India including Pampers Diapers.. and yup, no complaints till now.."
Ok
Though I am using Pamper from last 2  years but product this time was of inferior quality and single pamper even didn't last 3 hours.
The product gets stuck to the kids body as small shreds even when he wears it for few hours
baby diapers with huge discount
Good price
Ok
OK
Consider with earlier pampers now it's quality is different.
Adorable products but premium diaper is more worth than this
"It's soft and good for your baby's soft skin and has a good absorbency, I recommend pampers as it is leak proof too."
Sddf
Up to the mark as expected
The name is enough Pampers 😊
Quality of the product is very low compared to the products we buy from stores.
Leak and very poor absorption. Please dont buy it.
This time received very faulty product .
Good one
"Item has been deliverd but with defective pakage, if i find count of diapers are less i ll lodge a complain"
Product was OK but delayed delivery by almost a month
too good baby diaper don’t trust on negative comments
Thanks
Thank you

The quality is getting inferior in comparison to the previous one....starts leaking withinin 2-3hrs....and not suitable to use overnight...
Best diaper ever used..very comfortable and rash free for my 10months old baby..go for it!
Material quality not good .....
Easy to use hai but leakage ka problem bahut hota hai
Bad quality because after using baby having likes don't bay
After using different pproducts for my daughter. Conclusion - Pampers is best.
Mrp 499/42pcs  is available in market and amazon is providing 499/38 pcs pack ....
Very nice product my baby never got rashes i use this pampers pants daily
Good
Grst Absorbance and very Smooth for the Use of kid's sensitive Skin with Leak proof
"Please don't buy this product,  totally waste of money...  It's not observing and more leakage with in 3 to 4 hrs.."
very comfortable for baby.  Absorb is very good compared to other brands.. doesn't leak.. Overall a good purchase..
It absorbs the liquid and works fine overnight. Observed that it doesn't damage baby skin even used for over night.
"Hi Team,"
This product is not having good quality as this was known for best quality pls check the stock.
"The quality of the product is awesome..! Soft material.,perfect fitting and lasts for 12 hours...!"

Absorbency 4/5
leak Proof 3/5
Softness 4/5

"Awesome product ,my baby is very happy to use it ,long lasting till 8 hours for my baby"

Leakage is heavy and I think these are duplicate items.Strongly not recommended
Everything Fine.
Repeated Order but delivery not available at my location.
"I find my baby being comfortable wearing pampers diapers, and would prefer getting the same again till required."
Quality is not good it's very thin and not at all fit for my 7 months child it's tight for him and uncomfortable
I am using pampers from last 7 years. To my new born it doesn’t suit even leaking within an hour . Money wastage
Good product soft on baby skin very speed delivery

Amazon thanks for getting this product at very reasonable price
the product was of very low quality with aloe Vera gel coming out . I doubt the genuity of the product!
The top layer after getting wet doesn’t stay dry for at least 3 hours..my baby got rashes after using..
I found Huggies much better as I used pampers twice and it leaks frequently as compared to other brands
Best diaper

might be the company changed the manufacturing material or I received the duplicate product.
Always the best
Defective Poduct Very Worst Quality Product

Like it...safe
It's good for daily use. But not for long time when u r traveling because it's leaked
I got it in a good deal.
I ordered for xl size but the diaper was so small that it barely fit my son. Mamy poko pants are much better..
First I had ordered taped diapers and what I got is diaper pants. The diapers quality is bad too as they leak.
Nice

Very disappointed. Poor absorbancy. Leaks every night
It is fine . But u will get it cheaper at Big Bazaar.
Easy
Pampers pants are excellent and easy to use which keeps my baby safe and happier and last long.
I want replacement because this is M size and I want L size product is not open so please replace wid L size
I prefer not yo buy this
Bcoz i havebought 56 piece of this n they all get torned only after 2 -3 hours
if your child sleep on his/her stomach than it leaks else leakage is not a problem.
Durable
