Review
It is seeming fake.
getting filled too fast. material is almost like paper.
waistband is not full..weird band. see photo. the monthly pack had 2 packets.  I want to return the other pack. one I have opened.. please reply
"I got Pampers pants on subsciption basis, and as a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past, I find this more reliable. We have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was of very good quality....but this new pack with""AIR CHANNEL"" is of wrost quality and leaking after 2-3hrs....very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately."
Poor delivery. Few diapers were soiled with mud stains as you can see in the picture posted. Had to throw them away. Waste of hard earned money.
"These new ""air"" diapers are not as durable as the previous ones. Cotton like threads hang out on the outside of the diaper even after using only for 4 hours."
"I know P&G for their quality, and have witnessed it over usage of this product for last 3 years for my Kid. The product on Amazon is a counterfeit product, it cant withhold the urine even for one and starts leaking. The layers are quite thin and seems cheap. You can best avoid this product and buy the other one listed with 48 as quantity. I am also surprised to learn that package of 48 is more expensive than the one having 64 units. Amazing economies of scale."
No sure if Amazon takes any action on having vendors sell fake products on their platform.
"We've been using this for two years. But the latest released version is so bad that we need to change in the middle of the night, otherwise it leaks. Sad to see a good brand ruining it's image and losing customers. Now I need to start over research on what's the next best brand. Pampers lost a customer, forever."
Really did not know that a prestigious company like P&G can do this with its customers... Worse diapers ever used... My baby has been crying since last two days and did not sleep well... Luckily i found that the moment we change the diaper she stops crying however just after a pee she agains starts feeling annoyed... Pls don't purchase it as company is selling rejected products in open market via amazon... Its may be due to large number of orders. Liquid starts flowing outside and inside. It sticks to skin and causes irritation to baby... Rashes did not appear as we frequently change diapers and wash with wet wipes before... Need an investigation by pampers team to check how a rejected product came to market... I repeat again... DONOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...
"These new pampers diapers are no doubt better than huggies in terms of durability. As there is no leakage and holds for long hours, even though it is much thinner. However, the material is pretty rough and I see red marks on my son's bum when I take off the diaper. I never had this issue with huggies even though leakage was an issue and it tends to clump up and wet making my son uncomfortable at night. Unfortunately i bought a monthly pack otherwise I would have bought huggies and used both alternately."
"Although am not a pampers favouring mommy, I've used them extensively for my 6 months old, especially when we had a major trip out of India. These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours. But now I've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now, leaving marks on her thighs. Anyway, it was a good time pampering my girl, until she gets to the larger group."
"The first one that I used for my son. The urine seeped out of the diaper. The diaper did not absorb. Am attaching pics of the same so that you can see that though the diaper is supposed to leak only if full, this is not absorbing at all. This pack is the new aloe lotion one. Never had this problem with the premium pack"
It doesn’t leak at all. It is the best in class Diaper for kids. It doesn’t give rashes and is very soft on skin.
Easy to use. Best brand in the market. No leakage of any kind. Good for baby upto 5 kg of weight.
I am buying Papmers since 10 months from Amazon but this time
the quality is too worst seems duplicate as it is not  working as it should be started leaking up aftyer 2 hours
also got skin infection under the diaper area
Aazon please take care of it
Too annoyed this time
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 11 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable..I always buy"
Pampers diapers from Amazon because it give great and best discount possible.. without any second thought go for it.
This product us amaze.its absorbancy power is alsorbancy power is awesome...its leak proof. its make baby comfort.there is no side affect if this.its veery soft..
"When I purchased without subscription, the product was so good as quality and Durability. But In subscription the product was so worst and as quality truly bad. My baby boy is suffering with rashes and every time itching the private part. It is very painful to see him in this situation and durability was so worst."
I have ordered it last this month and almost half count of one packet used. Can you please return it and back my money.
I am going to order this product as normal way and unsubscribe the offer.
Thanks
Ramendra
it is good product  and material is alsoo too good .. good quality product.. overall it is best product.
I have a baby and I used many no of diapers for my child but in every night give me low results but when I used this diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep ...I love this product
Totally nice Product By amazon With Less market Price
There are mixed quantities in single pack. Some are thin and some are thick.
Pampers made like that. Not a fake product.
Now they changed the design.
Though I have been using Pampers for my kid since a long time - I have multiple complaints and suggestion for P&G.
1. The pants are not as absorbent as you try to advertise it.
"2. It's not leak proof. Everytime my kid sleeps sideways, he ends up getting the bed wet :(."
3. The spread is not even. There is always a heavy concentration at one portion.
4. It's not rash proof. So this so called 'Aloe Vera' diaper is of no use.
Everytime I have a friend coming from The States - I hear one complaint over and over again - the diapers in India aren't that absorbent. Ofcourse they can't afford to carry a 50kgs bag only of diaper so with a lot of disappointment they switch to the diapers here only to find lil baby bums got a rash now.
The new Pampers pants is thin compared to previous one and the durability is not good as it leaks in one wetting itself and previous one was very good in soaking and would not leak...I really think that Pampers should manufacture it's product like before if it wants to keep up the brand name...overall its an okay product this time considering the fact that I have always bought Pampers pants for my kid for the past three years.
The product was good। The packaging was superb. The the brand like pampers is always worth trusting overall it is best among all and I must recommend you to have a look on it ones
"Have ordered these multiple times on amazon. Always got good ones, except this last time. I immediately noticed the difference, but we were about to travel and were in dire need of diapers. So I went ahead and used them. They aren't that bad honestly speaking. A high quality fake, but the reduced absorption capacity and the constant dampness inside even after just 1 or 2 susus gives it away. Have been very satisfied with the originals which I got in the previous purchases. Didn't expect this from amazon. And kudos to the maker of the duplicates! If one didn't have familiarity with the original, they won't be able to tell the difference!"
"This is the best diaper i have used in this price range. It is soft, very absorbing and leak proof (don't leave it for too long)."
"Also it would be very good and helpful if pampers provided a little disposable bags with the diaper. Not every Indian has a grabage heap lying around outside their house, or an open field, or rich neighbour with a dog to toss the diaper to and putting the poop ridden, germ carrying little sacks in a kitchen trash can and leaving it for a day at 47 48 degree celcius with other decomposing and exothermic garbage is not very hygienic."
"Believe me, during its disposal, you run out of all your saved plastic bags kept in another big plastic bag hanging behind the kitchen door and that big bag being empty, breaks your heart."
Earlier pampers was good..  but this time it's not good... Baby is getting rashesh... So as to check we brought premium one... It gives best result as compared to this product....
Want to return .. not return want replace it to premium qaultiy... But product is not under returnable policy... It too bad.....
Please help me in this regard as I don't want Amazon name to bad and stopping buying stuffs from online..
I have used many diapers for baby but pampers are one of the best diapers.  Because its really soft and leak proof.  It absorbency is really good as compared to other diapers. It locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it.  And there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies.  This new upgraded version of the product is really good.
Good product received on friday. I have bought this for my nephew. When i opened the packaging scent like smell came i am impressed by that and this diaper also absorb a lot without becoming heavy.
Pampere all night diapers actually give comgfort for the whole night.
The diaper pants are easy to put on .
Easy to tear it while removing.
Also it Dosent leak at all..thats the best part.
I will prefer these pants over other brands..also got it for a decent rate on amazon.
"These New Pampers Baby-Dry pants style diper I use it for my baby last all night without any leakages, so I would definitely recommend them to all. You will feel reassured that your baby isn’t ever sleeping in wet sheets. This pants diaper also hug the child's waistline and so stay in place nicely. My baby did not have any skin reactions, showing that this product is made of high quality materials.This product has given my baby confidence, which makes me happy. My life is easier because we no longer have to deal with any skin reactions or rashes and my baby is comfortable. I love that the pants are so easy to pull up and down, requiring no effort at all. Thank u Amazon fastest delivery and packing was also good."
Brought this for my nephew
I have tried every brand of diaper and pampers is all I will ever buyGood for the night time We have been using these for about 4 months on our 9 month old new . We use these at night . These are nice because they are more flexible then other brands they are ideal for sleep time I am extremely satisfied and we recommend this to everyone.
And it has very fast delivery
"I am buying this Pampers for the last 2  year and the product was extremely good, but this time, I received a product with slightly different design and I thought they must have improved the design. But to my disappointment, the updated product is worst. It leaked for consecutive 2 nights since I started using it. And also the product quality is inferior. Never expected Pampers to introduce a product without any trials. Now that I have purchased a 128 nos box, I am left with no choice."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
"Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness. We haven't got any issues with leaking through my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body Flexible waistband that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit. highly recommended product."
"The pampers are off pathetic quality as I am using the same in Germany and they hold up through the day, This one leak and has some perfumed coating. When you pay a premium to get the best for your kid, the quality surely disappoints. Any other diaper in the market does a better job."
P.S not attaching any pictures as the pictures will be of a toddler's leaked diapers.
This isn't a genuine product because when I buy the same from a shop and use it my son sleeps through the night and the diapers dont leak but these diapers I purchased from Amazon always leak within couple of hours n my son gets up...would have given zero stars if there was an option because my baby wakes up crying in his sleep when he wears them because of the wetness n leak which also runs our bedsheet
What i orderd that i was getting.pemper is the best company for baby pant.packing was gud.product was nice.
Diapers quality is good and comfortable for my baby. Very easy to use just wear them like a pant and at the time of removing it tear it from any side of the diaper. Baby is new born and its a fit and leak proof pants.
This is the first time I am trying pampers for my son.. it's definitely not up to the mark.. I am not even sure what I got was original..
I got the product through subscription service provided by Amazon.. it took 10 days to receive the product..
The diaper design and everything look similar to original product.. its really soft... but absorbency level is very low.. we have change the diaper mid of the night to avoid leakage..
Great for both baby's and mother's sleep..
"This product is very helpful for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 20 units , each consists of air channels which provides  dryness whole night . Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good . I got this delivered in just within 2-3 days . It was nicely packed and properly sealed ."
It is not at all soft. Left my kid with rashes all around. It is not leak proof too. Pampers of perhaps different sku was used earlier from the local market and it was absolutely fantastic. But the one bought from Amazon was totally shitty one. I was so desonant seeing rashes all around my kid. Also the size of both was M. But the one bought from amazon was smaller than the one bought from market. We have stopprd using it long back and now the M size from market is perfect. So i would not even give 1 in rating to this product.
"Recently I picked these up and they are wonderful! I wouldn't have thought before I was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praise.They are soft, very absorbent and fits great.These diapers provide up to 12 hours of leak-proof protection & are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortable.Totally love these diapers"
1) small size is for babies whors weight is around 5-8 kgs
2) 20 daipers would be there inside the pack
"3) one daipers will easily go for entire one night, as absorption is very good of pampers daipers"
"4) it's fragrance is very good, it smells like jhonsons powder, you would love it"
5) you won't feel like he has done toilet inside because of the wonderful smell
6) it contains aloe vera also in those daipers which will prevent baby skin from rashes and bad smell
When to change-
"If you made your baby wear a daiepr in the night, change it in the morning. You will start feeling the daipers to be quite heavy then you'll understand its time tk change the daipers"
Precaution:
"Don't make your baby wear the same daipers for entire one day, else it can cause health issue and rashes etc on baby skin, as baby skin is very sensitive"
Pros:
"1) buying diaeprs online is a good option as you can find offers and discount while buying daipers online, rather then buying it rate to rate on any medical store"
"Pampers pants diapers is the only product I trust and use for my baby. In terms of comfort, the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free. The 3 extra absorb channels, the best feature of this diaper style has ensured that I never had the problem of leaks and unnecessary changes during the nights or on long journeys. The style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks."
"In terms of pricing, I found that the online offers on amazon are more suitable and cost saving when compared to buying from the actual store."
I strongly recommend the Pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and money.I have heard of pampers even before I was a mother. Ever since my baby was born I have used pampers diapers for him. Its extremely soft for the baby skin.
Overall using Pampers Diapers have been a great experience for me. I have been Pampering my baby with Pampers diapers :) :)
"Worst Diapers Ever Purchased. Every single piece is leaking. Gives protection only for 3 hours. Can not use this for full night. In morning you will find your bedding wet because the diaper has leaked whole night. Trust me, dont go by fake reviews. This is the worst diaper . Probably duplicate, quite possible."
This monthly box comes in two sets (76 pants each) unlike 4 sets earlier. That wasn't a problem but now I feel the capacity of the pants has considerably reduced unlike before. The pants get full within 5 hours on most occassions & hence it has been a bit difficult specially during the night hours. My kid weighs 11.5kgs & to use Large diapers would be loose. This issue would be of concern more during winters when you don't want your kid to leak into the clothes.
"Otherwise, there aren't any issues."
"Worst Diaper ever, my baby is 3 months old.. i used only 5 diapers of this pack.. i use 1 diaper in a day for 4 hrs.... Rest of the time i prefer to keep my baby in cloth nappy."
This diaper is not comfortable to my baby... Baby always cry or fussy after wearing this.. it gives alot heat inside... My baby got red rashes that too i m using only for 4 hrs in a day..
I stopped using it... My packet got waste.
The diaper so called brand
Totally weste of money
This one compare to some other unknown diaper  brands.
This can't be more than 2 hour's max.
And other local I would say unknown diaper brands can as long as 6 to 7 hors .
I've tried both one by one.
And I found other diaper far better than this one.
So called brands. My foot.
I'm doing mercy on them to give one star.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation

😇not highly recommended
"This diaper is like a tissue paper and even damages also  ,my son as  did a twice a toilet in it but toilet starts coming out of it,he is 1 1/2 year old. This type of Diapers are providing in the Amazon ,then you people will say ""Our product is very good"".. You people will say that with 3 to 5 working days amount will be refunded ,but we should wait for more than 15 to 20 days for our amount ,you people are very great in misguiding the customers."
"First off, every child is different and every child has different reactions to diapers. All 3 of my children have been in Pampers. No diaper rash medicine ever needed. My oldest two I put in Luvs when they got older. Around 2. My youngest is just now turning 2 and he will be sticking with Pampers. With every brand of diaper I have tried with him he had leaked through except pampers. All my children have gotten rashes from Huggies. But I don't blame them, there is just something in them that don't agree with my children. I know a lot of people think that when buying Pampers you're paying more for the name, but in my case it has been the best. So as a caution. If your child gets a bad diaper rash and your not sure why, change your brand. Very poor quality. One pack menses 56 pants...pack inner 52 paints diapers"
I have always ordered diapers from Amazon but this time I hv received pathetic quality. Pampers hv always maintained there quality standards but I think there is some glitch. Diapers are DUPLICATE. Diapers hv granules kind of a thing in them which seals the flow in gel form but these diapers are very thin. Completely disappointed from this time..

Very light weight. And soaks very much compared to other brands. Soft material. Easy to wear and easy to tear. Fulfill what it claims. 1 pampers = 1 dry and peaceful night.
"Pampers have been my first choice as a diaper brand. I have been used Pampers for my first child also, and after 6 years now using again for my newly born baby."
"I always find Pampers diapers super comfortable, leak proof, with great absorbency. Now, as my baby has started crawling, I had tried Pampers pants, and again I am a happy customer. Main point is that my baby got no diaper rashes till date with pampers. Hoping to continue the friendship with Pampers intact."
I had this brought this product for my little one. It's quite good can be used upto 5 to 6hours. It's leak free. It's very comfortable for the baby I am using it at night. The material is quite good and my baby sleeps well at night when he wears Pampers. It's leak proof and soft for new born babies.
"Material quality is good for skin but the diapers absorbing material is so thin that u have to change it after 3-4 hrs. You cannot rely on single diaper for whole night. I ordered other pampers diapers, but this is worst. No option for return..."
"Pampers are so soft, baby is comfortable after wearing it whole night. We get 20 count pack. Leak proof as i mention worked whole night. No rashes after using pampers."
Delivered on time
Packaging was good
It is very usefull product for all babies. High quality and no leakage at all. Go for it if you are looking for leak proof and soft diapers for babies
"Says small size 5 to 8kg, but size is suitable for newborn to max 6kg, my baby weighs 4kg, and it's jus right for her. When I remove the diaper there are impressions of diaper elastic on tummy and thighs. Outer portion feels wet wen I pick up d baby..have used pampers tape style newborn baby diapers n really liked them..try d size with a smaller packet first before ordering, I ordered pack of 72 and now it's tight for my baby"
I am sharing my experience of the very product after using it for my  11 months old baby daughter.
1) First of all the price is really cheap when compared to offline stores.
2) Genuine product with recently manufactured date is really appealing
3) Provide enough comfort for babies so that it won't disturb their sleep at night.
4) For my 11 months old baby single diaper is staying for at least 4 to 5 hours in day time.
5) The fabric is really smooth and doesn't cause any rashes.
"6)  Once the diaper gets filled, it can start to leak."
7) Overall value for money product.

"When it comes to diapers, there are many options available in the market. I have a 6 montha kid and I have used many options before buying Pampers Baby dry pants too. Most of them lacked at a point or another."
"But I am quite happy with Pampers Baby Dry Pants. From this diaper, my expectations are met with this."
"*Easy to change, just tear it from sides."
*Comfortable.
"* Does not affect skin (go for one bigger size if possible as it will not affect babies skin, as wet diapers damages babies skin)."
*Good ability to absorb.
Everything is good about it.

"Thanks a lot to Pampers for making this product so good. Softness, absorbency is just perfect & leak proof too. Totally worth item. It hasn't got any issues with leaking though my child is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odor. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Does not have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
I have been using pampers since long. My elder daughter who is 7 yrs now also used pampers and my younger one 1.5 yrs is using currently.  With its high absorbency and leak proof desigh and snug fit it is highly recommended for babies and kids . My babies never had the diaper rash problem since I have used Pampers
I have been using a lot of diapers of different brands to make sure i use the best one for my 1 year old. Pampers is the BEST!!! recently one of my friends sons outgrew his size of diapers n she gave me her xl size of huggies diapers but it is not even close to pampers. I follow the rule of changing the diapers every 4 hours during the day. At night I'm ashamed to say i drop off dead n the baby is left with wearing the same diapers for almost 8 hours....but its pure magic.....never had rashes....i give pampers full marks....no other brand is even close
Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 10 hours of dryness
Leak Proof
no rashes
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
I have invested in Pamper's Pant Style Diapers for my toddler since sometime now and I like that the inner layer sits right against his skin.
"The diapers are soft and keep my baby relatively dry. They very well take the moisture away from the surface, distribute the liquid and keep it within it’s absorbent core."
"Since a good fit is important for comfort and leak prevention, I like that diaper material is elastic and pleating around the leg edges."
"My friends i m subscribing it now, because m happy with it."
Let's I'll explain whats things about it i like.
I m sharing my experience after using it for my baby'
👶👶👶👶👶👶👶
* First of all its totally odorless tats  why I like the most.
* Its have very comfortable elasticity tats  why baby feel comfort.
"* No rashes issue ,its really appreciable."
* No leakage of any kind. Good for baby up to  5 kg of weight.
*  Gel advantage baby's skin soft and  rashes-free. So its worth of money.
* As my experiences its best for infants.
Highly recommended....

Review got deleted mistakenly but i still wants to post as it helps others to choose product
"Clearly the best diapers available in the Indian market. I tried other brands also when my son was born but quickly realised that none of them matches the quality and softness of pampers. Have been using pampers ever since. I have never used any cloth diaper for my son although I bought quite a lot of them in anticipation of rashes due to disposable diapers. My son is 2.8 years now and except for a single episode of diaper rash, he never had any diaper rash or any other discomfort. I would advise all the new moms to go for these blindly. The quality will ensure that the soft skin of your baby is safe and the fact that they are disposable will save you from all the extra work and discomfort that comes with the use of cloth diapers."

Hello everyone please read reviews before purchasing products
First of all the product comes with nice quality packing with quick delivery.
The pads comes with nice quality inthe pack i got 20 count with long durability about 8 hours max.
It is easy to wear and weight up to 10 kgs of baby not more than that.
This pads gives the exact fit and keeps the child comfortable.
The alovera gel helps the baby from diaper rash and irritation.
It comes with leakproof and  absorbency period upto 8 hours.
Keeps the baby skin smooth without irritation useful for long nights .
I used both normal diapers & pants for my new born baby. Normal diapers are way too good & cottony soft. But these pants are a piece of plastic & the elastic on the pants gave elastic marks on my baby’s tummy. I don’t recommend using pants. Also pants are way lesser price than diapers. I bought pants & after observing this I just threw them away although it’s a wastage of money.
"We used Pampers with our first child with excellent results. We changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money. She started having yeast infection, rashes, and woke up fussing nightly. Medical treatment did not resolve symptoms. About 1 month into the switch we realized that her symptoms started after the diaper swap. Within 1 week of returning to Pampers we stopped topical treatment secondary to symptom resolution. She has been symptom free since. We should've have tried to cut the corner. Best of luck with your choice!"
"There is literally nothing better than this product in the market. This product is the standard. And it does set high ones too. Having tried all kinds of brands of diapers I can confidently tell you Pampers is the best.. Huggies and libero were good when your little one is really tiny but Pampers takes care of toddlers the best.. the gusset fits perfectly and never leaks unless you have left on the diaper for a longer time or if you have taken a wrong size, (undersize or oversized).. yes I learnt this the hard way 😁"
So always take according to baby's weight.
this product pampers is really good i order this product for my daughter she is approx 2months old and i was worried about wheather she got rashes or itching. or she wear it or not but the quality of material is good and soft and it fit perfectly the size of dipper is not so bulky so that u can also put a underwear over it. she wear it approx 6 to 7 hours and pee lots of time but there is no leakage the magic gel is too good even she didnot get any rashes also. i hear lot of time wearing a dipper for kids is not good thing in summer but they are wrong. thanks for pampers
"I disappointed with Pampers as I not expected this type of cheap quality diaper pants. It leaks frequently, its not absorb efficiently so my child feel irritation and have rashes on skin, its not at all soft material is so cheap."
"Pampers are all time fav to moms Pampers pants diapers is the only product I trust and use for my baby. In terms of comfort, the soft breathable material keeps the skin fresh and rash free. The 3 extra absorb channels,, The style is well suited for my active baby without leaving any marks."
I strongly recommend the Pampers brand of diaper pants to new moms not only because it offers the best protection but also because it saves time and money.I have heard
Overall using Pampers Diapers have been a great experience for me. I have been Pampering my baby with Pampers diapers :) :)
It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have.
I purchased it for my nephews.the Quality was good nd absorb easily.
The quality of the product received was very poor. It started leaking after 4 hours. I have being using this diaper for my kid since a year but this time the product was very poor. I think its a fake product. I Had received  this type of fake product 3 months ago again this time same experience. This was not expected from pampers.
"Price is very Low, other market s high"
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..

Seriously unhappy with Amazon because we placed an order for pampers large . Due to the worst quality of the diaper . We tried to return the product. They told it can't be returned. So they assured me that they will provide me a return less refund. But it is still pending. Called 2 times and they assured it has processed from their end. And the refund reference number is 000601. I'm going to display the same message and share with my friends who constantly purchase from Amazon. Its not about money but every month I purchase. still a very bad follow up.
"Pampers products are really harsh on my baby’s skin. It leaves marks all around the diaper area which is very concerning. I neglected people’s opinion regarding the product but now thinking should have gone through it. Product is durable, super thin , everything is good but the only problem is it is horrible on baby’s skin. I will never ever compromise on my baby for this matter"
I've been using pampers for my baby for a long time. Known for keeping the wetness away this has been my go to brand.
With the new air channels being introduced the wetness us absorbed and allows flow of fresh air onto baby skin. The aloe lotion keeps the skin soft. The expandable waist band makes it easy for the baby to wear. Overall the baby bum stays dry the whole night. It's leakproof and cotton like softness is one of the reasons pampers is a trusted brand.
giving pamper to your baby is just like totally pampering to the child no rash no itching no spots no dark shading to skin etc. Its like total care of using pamper diaper even though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all. it good to use pamper said to all mom
pampers is very trusted brand and diapers are best in this range. me and my wife always worried about the baby hygiene and cleanliness and always think of product which will give protection to kids and are safe. this diapers are great in this matter and always give complete protection to babies and this diapers lock the wetness inside which makes the baby comfortable and diapers can be used comfotably. the size is exactly good for carrying in travelling. in travelling its very good to use.
Nothing is more important than the comfort of little baby. These diaper pants keep baby comfortable in the day as well as in night. cottony soft material is gentle on baby’s skin keeping their precious skin perfect. Good absorbing power observed used it for 8 hours or more. Really good product. Best diapers at best price. 
It is the 100% original product from Amazon. There is no any problem of rashes at all.
"Just go for it,I am sure you will not be unsatisfied with this product."
And thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..

I have purchased Pampers diapers online first time. I was worried about the
"product quality, but after getting the product in hand I am totally"
satisfied. I can tell you all that the product is genuine because last one year I have purchased diaper from various local shops and I know the original product quality. I am very happy with it and I am surely buy
Pampers diapers from amazon next in future. It gives comfort to my child and me as it is leak proof and easy to use.
"I have used Pampers earlier. It's a trustworthy brand. But don't know what happened this time. I bought the monthly box. Within half an hour of usage my baby had severe rashes, redness and itching in the diaper area. Terrible it is. Worst part they can't be returned also. My whole money got wasted. Each and every diaper of the box gave itching to my baby. So had to throw all in the dustbin."
"The fit of these diapers runs on the smaller side compared to other brands, which may mean you have to experiment before landing on the right side, or size up more quickly than you’d expect. “To avoid poop blowouts, purchase the next size up,” noted one mom. That said, for smaller babies, the close fit is perfect."
Baby is getting rashes and after urination the diaper is like very warm as in Luke warm water hotness and it stays that way for 15/20 mins even after removing it . I have used Pampers when bought from medical shop and never faced this . Somehow feels like of it's chemical reaction or something ..my baby is getting little bit of rashes .also the diaper itself feels more paperish than the Pampers I got from medical shop ..I have used Pampers from the time my baby is small but this is experience is weird .
These new pampers  diapers are no doubt better than other buggies in terms of durability. I know about the p&g product and their  quality. And baby feel comfortable while wearing it. And packaging  is hygiene.  And there is no issue of leaking and also too soft for baby  .pampers pent diapers  also fit to the baby
Lotion with Aloe Vera is Really nice & which help to protect child skin too.😍. It's cotton is very soft.. Magic Gel with light & dry too. Best Pampers for new born child go & buy now.
"Product quality is too good .. I'm using pampers for the very first day for my son ,he enjoys in pamper pant  .. he is wearing diaper a most of the day and dosen't get rash but from the other brands pampers are very genuine product .. super comfy , great absorbency ... over all i'm totally satisfied with pampers and should recommend to the other moms .. happy motherhood .. ..u can easily trust this brand for your newborns too..  I have no complaint till now"
Just tried considering all the branding and name but completely disappointed with the quality forget few hours not worth for few mins .. horrible Product will never buy worst no refund and return ...
"I bought from FirstCry and the quality is so much different. Better fragrance, liquid is not clogged at one spot but spreads more evenly. Better material and soft. All this while I purchased premium diaper due to this when she was less than a year. Later switched to standard did not have a good experience."
Ordered from FirstCry and then I felt the seller on Amazon cheated.
I have also tweeted about the same.
Worst diapers... Very cheap quality..bought 7 to 12kg but not even fitting for my 7kg baby... It leaves scars on his waist.... Very disappointed... Hope i cud return but cannot as i opened it... Not expected from pampers.. Worst experience ever... Went back to pampers active baby... Bit costly but active baby pampers are best for my baby as it will absorb pee more than 3times...just go for pampers active baby...
"I have been using Pampers baby dry pants for my baby girl. Earlier I used to feel guilty of making my baby wear diapers overnight since elders said it's not good for their skin. But when I tried Pampers I was really happy with the product, since it kept her dry at night for a longer time. She feels comfortable while playing, sitting, crawling, since it's flexible and soft. There are no diaper band marks on her thighs. Have not experienced any kind of severe rashes till now. It's very easy to pull them on the baby with the kind of active movements while making her wear. Have tried Huggies and Mamypoko also, but I find Pampers baby dry the most comfortable."
"Although am not a pampers favouring.  I've used them extensively for my 6 months old, especially when we had a major trip out of India. These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours. But now I've had to switch to other brand because of them being too skinny for my girl now, leaving marks on her thighs. Anyway, it was a good time pampering my girl, until she gets to the larger group"
"Pampers baby-dry pants style diapers are the only pants in India to whom I can trust overnight, just because of breathable dryness,  we are using these diapers from day one. Pampers that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness"
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body  so I can't  think to change other dipaer.  And we all use  aloevera in our daily routine so why don't use with baby's diapers.Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation"
"Cotton like soft material, my baby can sleep very comfortable."
This product is just not right for babys gentle skin.
I got the small size as my baby 5+  kgs in weight . These pant style diapers are too tight on the waist and leave a mark on the thighs as well .
I could feel my baby was uncomfortable hence did not use it .
Best is to go for the taped diapers which can be adjusted as per baby size.
Highly dissapointed.
Absolutely

Pampers is my choice when I buy diapers for my baby.!
The reason I choose these diapers only is they are good absorbent and yet they are extremely soft. No rashes issues. The most important thing about this is till date never had any leakage issue.!
Amazing.
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 18 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable..I always buy"
Pampers diapers from Amazon because it give great and best discount possible.. without any second thought go for it.
Its a good product with supersoft and super absorbant material.
"Its cottony soft material prevents developing rashes. Its magic gel helps locks wetness for up to 10-12 hours. It fits comfortably, closer to the baby’s body ."
Goodness of aloevera lotion prevents babys skin from any type of irritation and its air channels provides proper movement of air inside daiper to maintain freshness and dryness.
I recomment for daily use for those having babies.
Worst item I received boz it’s leaking with every time baby poop. I used mamy poko pants previously for 4 month never faced leakage issue with it changed boz baby got little bit rashes. But I think wrong decision in choosing pampers diaper. Very much disappointed. Its showing can’t replace or return so wat now. What the use of wearing diaper if poop is leaking out every time. Worst diaper I bought from amazon.
"First off, every child is different and every child has different reactions to diapers. All 3 of my children have been in Pampers. No diaper rash medicine ever needed. My oldest two I put in Luvs when they got older. Around 2. My youngest is just now turning 2 and he will be sticking with Pampers. With every brand of diaper I have tried with him he had leaked through except pampers. And its is very soft than others brands. All my children have gotten rashes from Huggies. But I don't blame them, there is just something in them that don't agree with my children. I know a lot of people think that when buying Pampers you're paying more for the name, but in my case it has been the best. So as a caution. If your child gets a bad diaper rash and your not sure why, change your brand."
"This isn't leakproof. The absorbency has come down. Until the time we used the large size daiper there were no issues. Since we started to use the xl size things were a mess. The daiper doesn't even stay dry for 4 hrs ( claims of 12 hrs dryness seems like a joke now). My baby's weight is 12.5kg, hence changed to xl. Absolutely dissatisfied. I had to cancel the subscription."
Never before this order did I face leakage issues with Pamper diapers. The potty stained the pants almost everyday and surprisingly inspite of diaper being worn there was bed wetting which also disturbed the baby's sleep and made him very irritable.
PS : There was no size mismatch in selection. Bought a pack of Pampers from local market and there were no leakage issues.
"I was using xyz diapers for a very long time.They were soft but used to be leaky and heavy within 6 hours.But ever since I was introduced to Pampers baby dry pants(lotion with aloe vera),my baby is more active because diaper is no more heavy or leaky even if the diaper is on for 10 hours.Also she gets a good night sleep because it’s comfortable and soft.My husband has stocked up on a large packet of the same.Unlike other diapers this doesn’t get teared.Packaging is good too."
As usual does the purpose
Have been purchasing diapers from this brand for soo long.
Still now no issue have been there
My little brother is soo relaxed.and my mom also.
Absorbancy is good and can hold for long.
Pampers helps every mom in everyday life..
And i am also helpful to mom.cause i get at low price than from offline stores
Thnks amazon
It is soft and doesn't give any type of rashes. Fits very well with more comfortness and Keep ur baby dry at whole night with its long lasting magic gel feature that really works and locks wetness away. This is the best among in class daipers.
"My first ever diapers purchased from online and thank u amazon and seller for ur fast delivery, received within 15 hrs just after one night gap."
"I use pampers pants for my kids from the time they were born . These pant are so comfortable for kids and are skin friendly. You can get these pants at affordable price from amazon if u r on tight budget . Pampers pant are so light weighted , soft and never had leaks complain ever. Earlier I use other brand diapers but they were not up to the mark but when it comes to pampers pants it never loose elastic . It has a magic gel and has great absorption channel and has breathable soft belt and cuff . Overall thanks pampers for this and i must say to buy these diapers for your kids....."
"I doubt genuineness of the product. Quality is so poor that its difficult to believe its made by pamperes. If its genuine then pamper is selling an extremely poor products. The product doesn't do the basic job it is supposed to do. It doesn't absorb. Size is also smaller. Before this i used for my baby Huggies, Mamy Poco and was totally satisfied. Amazon customer please do not get misled by rating or favourable review. Stay away from this item."
A good product for your baby.Material is soft so no worry of rashes or discomfort.
Magic gel does what it has too and improved design helps in more comfortness to baby's skin.Waist band is one more good feature of it.You can use lotion with aloe vera if your baby's skin is extra sensitive to overcome rashes however I don't think there'll problem of it if you use this product
"This pamper which i received through amazon seems FAKE. It starts leaking and the design and product quality is entirely different from what i have bought before. The pamper pant tear's frim the waist while i start to put it on my baby. And the absorbtion is also very poor. Dont want rhis product and subscription. After facing this problem ,gone through the review's ,many customers have same problem that means you all are cheating us, and giving face product."
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
Till now never had the problem of urine leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very happy and impressed with pampers diaper pants and recommend this to all looking out for diapers
The absorbency is very good. It absorbs quickly and doesn't get wet for long time. It is also leak proof as the pampers fits great and there's no space for leakage. The material used to make pampers is very soft and it can be used for long time. I think this is the best selling diaper among others.I purchased it from Amazon and the delivery was also quick.
"We are using pamper for babies since they are 6 month old. Now they are 21 months old and we shift to large size from medium. This was my second or third order, 9 or 10 Pampers out of 164 nos was good one but rest was completely damage. It's look like pamper are damage from side like some one teared it from side. This should reject during quality check of finished product. We regularly using pampers for babies. Company should work on quality of product it's leaking badly, we faced this problem in past during use of medium size. Kindly make some quality check at Amazon end also. We are purchasing this considering Amazon certified product hence please check the quality."
"Based on Trust, purchased Pampers. But the quality and absorb proof is not up to the mark. It can be used 3-4 hours max for 18 months baby. Urine is not spreading entire diaper and it's stay in one place like a ball."
There is no return option and it's waste of money. Never ever buy Pampers product like this.
"No other words to say, Simply Waste."
Perfect companion for my toddler.Absorbs all the fluid but with delicacy.The soft waist band fits very well yet doesn't give any rashes on the baby's skin.So my baby always feels very happy and relaxed.It has also magic gel with aloe vera to lubricate my baby's skin against diaper irritation.I am pretty sure my baby is loving it as i can guess from his smile.Thanks for this product pampers as u really pamper the babies as well as the parent's feelings.
Pampers a well known product by P&G. Recently ordered this product for my new born Nephew.
New air channels technology with thin and soft layer of cotton like material on top.
Which keeps the baby dry for the whole night with magic gel that locks wetness away and its aloe lotion helps to protect the baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation. 
Without thinking twice just place the order.
This is one of the best products. It has baby lotion with aloe Vera that helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation. It has also air channels that providing your baby a new type of dryness overnight. I am happy to purchase it for my baby .he also like to wear for it compatible design. Value for money. Recommended to every one for  try this product.
"Pampers New Diapers Pants, Medium size is one of the best Pampers bought as well as the trusted product.  The absorbency is the crucial thing and that is up to there mark. This Pampers is full value for money. The Pampers are leak-proof as well, help the baby to sleep comfortably. This Pampers prevent etching as well, because of there softness. Highly recommended Pampers."
"I have been using the premium pants for a while, and will vouch for its efficacy. Now i just thought of trying the dry pants. It is to be worn as pants and is more suited for babies above 6 months. I generally do not recommend diapers all the time, however, these are convenient for outdoors. They do deliver the promise of keeping our babies light and dry."
" It is absorbant, lasts all night and fits well to not cause any discomfort to my baby. As its name says it pampers my baby's skin. Also being a mom can be tiresome and overwhelming. A diaper that fits well and lasts long is a BIG help!"
"I have received pamper on this month, very bad product, not for use."
I doesn't stand even 2-3 hr.  It also leak.
"Earlier the same product is good, my baby is using this product by Amazon from last 2 year, but this time quality is very poor."
I want to replace the product.
Please do not buy these pampers diaper it is total waste of money worst diaper.  I have been using Huggies always for my kid but my friend told me to try pampers so this time I ordered pampers damn they made up such a bad quality that it can't even stay for 3hrs damn they lie please don't buy pampers I would suggest to go for Huggies the best diapers.
Bought this for my niece and she feels very comfortable wearing it. It also lasts longer as there is no leakage. Material is very soft in short i am in totally love with the product. I ordered this just for a month but now i will buy more.
"We all heard about pampers and it's a well known baby diaper company. Trusting the brand, I go with the product. But since the diaper waist is low, when my child passed out her poop, it leaked out from the waist. We can't always predict when a child will pass his/her poop, right? For safeguarding her urine, it works fine though. Therefore, I had to switch to another diaper brand and I'm happy to chose Teddyy premium diaper. Lesser price and works better for my child."
It was a blunder to get Pampers. This size is smaller or equivalent to the S size. I got the mega size which now I am changing every after 2 hours so that my baby is not soffocated and secondly to get over with the pack.
We have been using Pampers product from last many years but this time I'm very much disappt with quality as durability is not good and Early leakage. Material quality is also not good.  I have opted for L size but looks like L size diaper...Kindly send the normal comfort diapers which stays for 6-8hrs.. check the quality before delivery. I think action has to be taken quickly on this as many have the same concern
Not happy with the product
Don't think it's the original product
"M using the pampers from last ten months n was very satisfied with the product but was getting from the market .i have first time ordered from online n it seems to be  a fake product ,so request the company amazon also to plz look into the quality of the product n I really don't want even a single star to give ,highly disappointed with the product 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
"Pack contains two types of mixed diapers.  Both are differed in cartoon print and quality.  One of them is really good,  seems original.  But another cartoon print diaper is very dirty.  It over fill within 2_3 hours. Cotton starts  coming out within half an hour.  It just don't have durability to hold wetness.  However another one is seems original and lsts for 7_9 hrs.  I tried for both the cotton print diapers, meaningfully observed this for 2_3 consecutive days and then only writing this review. There is some issue with the pack.  This happening second time with me.  Same experience with mamy loko pants as well.  I got completely duplictae diapers pack. There is some duplicate diapers mixed in the pack. Please take a note."
I have been using pampers since ever and it is the best for my baby. Though in between intried some other brand diaper but i was not satisfied enough and switched back to pampers.
It is extra soft on my baby's skin and he does not get any irritation and rashes..
It also stays dry for a longer period of time without any leaks.
The best part about this diaper is it has aloe vera baby lotion which keeps my baby's skin healthy .
I am very much satisfied with pampers and obviously I am not switching to any other brand for my baby ever.
This pampers pants is great....its is a great brand... these pants are very comfortable to the body.....as well as it do not leaks ....it xn soke upto many times....i highly recommend it to use it for u kids
"I have been buying this for my baby for past 18 months. Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was satisfactory quality.... but this new pack with""AIR CHANNEL"" is extremely inferior and poor quality and it leaks after 2-3hrs.... very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately"
"Using this for my nephew boy age 3 months. Its soft material and powerful absorbency helps the baby to stay dry. I will continue to use only pampers, no other brand gives such great comfort and leak proof performance. Happy with the product."
"This is the best diaper I have used so far. One diaper is enough for full night/day. Holds a lot of liquid, about 6 glasses which is more than required for any baby. The fitting is just perfect for my baby n it doesn't slip or open up."
Quality alway g8
I was using huggies premium taped diapers for my new born and then moved to this with size S
"It leaves mark on the stomach, poty check is difficult in pant style, this is personal choice however I would like to go with taped diaper on my nxt purchase."
"I felt this required to be changed every 2 hour, not happy."
"This doesnot have a wet indicator line, neither disposable roll"
"I usually order this from Amazon and have received a good bunch in the past. Somehow this batch of diapers seem to be of really bad quality and are causing too many rashes.By end of the day, my daughter is howling in pain and I have to regularly apply an ointment. Not sure if I can return this for a refund"
best product for my baby. and i always buy something which i can trust 100% for my baby. The soft and smooth Pampers baby pants adjusts to my baby's skin very well and its very light weight to wear. The price of pants is too much reasonable and the quality is very high. I have tried so many brands till now but Pampers has satisfied me to the fullest.
I'm buying pampers pant style diaper for my baby since more than a year. The product quality that I received 3days ago is not as ever before and it is written 'aloe' infront of each diaper. Even earlier diaper packets were of aloe lotion type but it is not written in the diaper.
"Text in front is not a problem, diaper thickness is reduced and it was not able to withstand whole night. I had to change the diapers in the midnight to avoid leakage."
Writing this review after a trail for 3days with this modified diaper.
I am a regular buyer of pampers daiper you can also view my order details where I have purchased more no of daiper..but this time I have to bring it to your notice that aftr using this particular one my child is being suffering through serious rashes... before bringing it to your notice and also Putting such remarks I compared with the other daiper of the same brand I can see the difference...both the product looks the same but when you smell it there is a difference from the one which I brought from Amazon.. usually I buy all my products from Amazon pantry. But after having such problem with my child I had to immediately buy it from a near by chemist. And from there  I compared n I CLD make the difference..now how are you guys going to help me when all of the daipers will be a waste because I cannot use it. And it's not a small amount. It's the 1st time I am facing such problem but the 1st has been an nightmare for my child... please suggest what shld I do with the rest of the daipers I have hardly used  more than 4
"Have been using pampers for the last four years. First for my son. Now for my daughter. It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power, and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have. It is also economical if you check the price per diaper.Thanks to amazon."
Cushiony Cotton Soft Material all round keeps my baby’s precious skin perfect. Outstanding Absorption Upto 12 Hours wraps my baby in a world of comfort. Advanced Dry Touch Sheet keeps my baby dry all night long. Super-Stretchy Material fits my baby like a mother’s Hug. Double Leakguard to keep my baby full sleepy in night. I highly recommend this diaper. A must buy diaper.
"My first choice is ""Amazon"". Better to buy through subscribe and save.It is the best one for babies than any other brand diapers. Bought it for my little sister during winter they can sleep whole night comfortably, there is no leakage problem and the best thing is in morning also it is dry. It is number one in softness and absorbency. Everything is OK but it is a bit expensive than Huggies and many poko pants."
"I have a 3 year boy who still not potty trained, my boy uses this diapers which are very confortable for him, he runs a lot, climbs all the stuff, jumps... I have a very active child, diapper does not have leakages. Its also thin so its discreet but absorves a lot. I dont understand the negative reviews, maybe just a bad experience from diferent seller. I get mine always from cloudtail India and always is nicely packed and fast delivery as well. I buy XL for my son and suits perfectly but he is also slim but tall so buy according to your childs weight. Its worth it, a good value for money a superb quality and easy to use. Buying it again soon :)"
Since from my baby birth I am using pampers dipers.
I love pampers dipers very much
Because it's
Has 24hr absorbency
It is leak proof and
Its has too soft ness that my were it comfortable
Till now there is no rassesh on my baby skin
It really keep baby skin soft and smooth.
This is choice of all mothers for its baby
Material is really soft and being in pant style easy to make kids wear. The quality of this product is good. Kids feel comfortable while wearing it & also it lasts for good 5-6 hours. The packaging is hygiene. Would recommend it to all.
I would like to thank the pamper diaper pants because of which I'm able to sleep at night in peace.No more sleepless night now!!!! The material is so soft that it's totally rashfree. The gel inside creates like a magic and always keeps the skin dry... It's cent percent leak proof too. The aloe vera helps to keep the skin soft and totally rash free. No more need to apply and rashfree cream or lotion now.
Ive been using Pampers pant style dipers from the last 5 years for my daughter and now for my son too...i have never face any issue with its quality. Infact the diapers have never leaked or torn out. They last the entire night without any issue. Pant style are easy to put it on for the kids. I have been using it for a long time and can vouch for it.

"Original review: March 4, 2019"
"We used Pampers with our first child with excellent results. We changed with our second child around 1 year old to save money. She started having yeast infection, rashes, and woke up fussing nightly. Medical treatment did not resolve symptoms. About 1 month into the switch we realized that her symptoms started after the diaper swap. Within 1 week of returning to Pampers we stopped topical treatment secondary to symptom resolution. She has been symptom free since. We should've have tried to cut the corner. Best of luck with your choice!"
Pampers dry pants are good quality diapers.  It is superior and longer at the back in comparison to other brands and they do a fair job. This is my choice For night time sleeps.
"I had tried about every brand of nappies to try and keep my baby dry all night without having to change her. These were the only ones that actually delivered on their promise. Price is competitive, no regrets !! Nice product overall.."
"I have tried many diapers for my son but every time some issue arouse like rashes, leak proof or softness so my friend suggested this. It's been 5 days my son using their is no leak proof and their is no rashes also. And also material is soft. The only issue is the elastic material is bit fit otherwise its must use for children."
These are the only diapers I will use. They are gentle on my babies skin and it takes A LOT to make them leak (as long as they are properly put on; hard to do on a squirmy little one I know). I am allergic to latex and these diapers are the only one i have tried that doesn't break me out and contains the contents well. Very close to feeling like cloth diapers. Pampers did a good job.
"We have been using Pampers XL size for a long time now. But this product(sold under brand name Pampers) is of cheap quality. It does not soak much. Till morning, diapers start overflowing."
I purchased 2 pampers from a nearby shop to compare the quality. I must say that the latter one soaks much better than this one.
I am completely dissatisified with this retailer's product and decided to not purchase from this retailer again in future.
Pampers have always been the first choice when it comes to diapers. And yes when you have to buy for your baby nothing is a compromise. This has been a choice from day 1 and we rely on Pampers till date. The absorbency is great. The material is soft and doesn’t cause any itching or rages in baby’s skin. Recommended to all new parents!
I ordered this for my Nephew and the quality of the product is good...
It is a nice product and a little relax now from the frequent baby crying.
Have been using for the last four years. First for my son. Now for my daughter. It is very soft on the bum and doesn't cause marks or rashes. It also has great absorbency power and lasts all night. Doesnt have any sort of strong smell that some other brands have. It is also economical if you check the price per diaper
"It becomes full fast n heavy wen ur toddler urinates..unlike wen u buy d same brand frm international destination wich v bought wen v were Outta country. V tried Himalaya pants as well but tht used to get filled up faster then these pamper pants. So if u use Himalaya pants, then this is d better option."
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
Till now never had the problem of urine/stool leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and pro active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very impressed with pampers diaper pants
Poor quality.  Hardly lasts 6 hrs.  Have to wake up at night to change it otherwise it overflows n soils bedsheet. Also it doesn't keep baby dry even during use.  maybe its amazon selling substandard diapers to show big discounts
"Would love to thanks Pamper team for creating this amazing pants with goodness of aloe vera, my baby's skin is sensitive diaper does not suits him but this range is luxourious, does not give any harm or rashes to the skin , the quality is amazing and its more absorving, help my baby to sleep peacefuly during nights!!!!"
"Pampers, my trust for my baby. I like this diaper as it absorb more.. Leak proof and vey soft from inside so that my baby feel good all the time. Came with good packaging and on time."
Pant style diapers are very easy to use and after using easy to dispose. Thank you Amazon for providing good service.
"Easy to use It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"This product is really nice and I use it for my 9 months baby and it works very well I make him this diapers the whole night and the absorption power is really good my baby sleeps nicely and its too comfortable. So, I don't have any issues with the diaper he feels nice and when he feels nice I am happy with the product."
"Out of 86 I had used only one diaper, the experience was terrible. For the first 20 mins I was surprised why my 6 month old baby is crying subsequent realised the entire bum has swollen in to red... No way I can think of Pampers ever"
I opened the pack and all the 5 Diapers used till now leaked!!!!!! Even the usual Pampers are very soft this
particular product is lil harsh....Looks the product is duplicate!!!!!
I have used previously from 3 months Pampers Don't know why This issue ?
Request Amazon to look whether its Supply problem or seller problem
"We loved these Pampers Swaddlers diapers. now we have a new baby, these are the only diapers I'll buy. They are excellent quality, far superior to Huggies and Luvs. The Swaddlers are so soft and flare easily around the legs and the tabs stay put on the front of the diaper, so with both girls, we've never had a blowout or leaky diaper. These easily hold 8 hours worth of urine from the baby sleeping all night and don't even leak when she sleeps on her belly with her behind up."
"I read a lot of reviews that the material is substandard and the child had leakage after wearing these hence giving a notion that it's better to buy from shop than online from Amazon,so I was very dicy in ordering it,nonetheless I did and to my utter surprise they were as good and effective to use as the one I would buy from shop..Since then I have always been buying from them..May be it depends upon the seller for the product..Anyways my experience of the same was perfect..No issues so far.."
I am extremely excited to collaborate with Pampers - a brand that I have believed in very strongly from Day 1! I literally carried a packet of Pampers to the labour room having made it crystal clear to my doc that my baby should be made to wear Pampers only!
"Interestingly, Pampers is what Pampers does.. pampers your baby's skin with air channels for an awesome experience of dryness! It lets your baby be comfortable and move around without any feeling of itchiness and irritation! Some of the interesting features that I totally swear by:"
1. Lotion with Aloe Vera - Helps protect my baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation.
2. Super soft
3. Playful designs on the exterior
4. Flexible waistband for comfort movement
From one mommy to another.. do yourselves a favour..pamper your baby with Pamper.
"I have been purchasing pampers pants diapers since many months and I was satisfied with the quality.. But this time I am very much disappointed and angry with the seller.. I have ordered monthly box of diapers and I have received fake product this time. There is no xl written on diaper, material is hard and rough, my baby is so uncomfortable in these. Absorbency is also not up to the mark.. Now I m afraid to order this in future again"
"I have been ordering diapers on Amazon and always received good products. However this time I ordered the monthly mega box and have received duplicate diapers. It does not even last for 2 hrs. The elastic around the thighs break easily and causes leakage. This is forcing me to change double number of diapers a day. No return or refund. Very disappointed.. I buy products regularly from Amazon, but now am skeptical to order anything"
I like this product caz it's very soft and comfortable to kids. Material quality superb and your durability up to 12 hour
I practically swear by this product.  I have tried many other brands and types but Pampers pants style diapers are the best. They keep my baby's skin dry and stay dry longer . Along with this they now also have aloe which is very good for baby skin.  It's super convenient to use as I can very easily tear side and change it.  I totally recommend it for all babies
It's a fake product..its absorbency is 0..and it leaks ..using same product which I bought from retail shop and very satisfied with that but with online product this is happening for the second time that the quality is so poor that I cant evn use it..moreover I cant return this product as well ...useless for me ..cant trust online for dis nymore afterall it's for babies who really have delicate skin ..
"I got Pampers pants on subsciption basis, and as a user of its competitor's diaper pants in the past, I find this more reliable. We have'nt got any issues with leaking though my daughter is a heavy wetter, and most importantly in the morning, the diaper does not emanate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. Never did we ever have rash issues after switching to this and got a subscription pack being very impressed with the quality and pricing offered. As a bonus, diaper is pre-folded in a way it occupies lesser space in the diaper bag."
"Product was defective. It can not maintain dryness for even 3 hours. During night it is leaking and I had to get up 2 to 3 times to change diapers. Since I disposed off the packaging, I could not return it. This is my first bad experience from amazon"
Worst product ever received by Amazon. My baby got terrible rashes with boils due to this diaper. I would never recommend it for any baby. Kindly do not experiment with your babies tender body using this useless product. Amazon being such a leading brand should verify the products of the seller. I can never believe that pampers being such a big brand could sell such cheap quality diapers.
My Brother Baby spends whole night peacefully after wearing Pampers pants &
It's the most trusted brands since ages so without a fail it's carrying on it's legacy and it passed on from my mother to me and I'm happy with it's use.
Love Pampers because my Brother baby loves it too & is comfortable for her
"Older version with""Extra absorb channel"" was of very good quality....but this new pack with""  AIR CHANNEL  "" is of wrost quality and leaking after 2 - 3hrs....very much shocked by such product from Pampers... please bring back older version and stop production of this newer version immediately."
I bought pampers-premium one and that meets standard of good diapers...
"This one is like other cheap diapers and don't come with lock blue tape, because of which its unhygienic after getting soiled and needs one poly bag to cover, which is again not environment friendly..."
Useless product... It get leak even after 3 to 4 pee. Also baby's bambee remains wet . I had never expected that from pampers.. While I have use pamper active baby for my newborn baby that was so good but this S size pamper pants are very poor in quality and durability... So many diapers are left as I have ordered 86 piece pack... Only used 17 of them
"I am using this product for my child since last 2 years. It was really good in previous times but this time I ordered and subscribed it for repeat orders, I got really worst product ie rejected material they are selling in lower price. It starts leaking in just 2-3 pees in 1.5-2 hrs. Not expecting this from pampers. Also not expected from this seller."
Great Product. So Soft. Parents can live tension free life if they use pampers for their children.
Waist band gives full flexibility to baby's movements and magic gel locks wetness well.
And Parents should consider using any baby lotion along with pampers to protect baby skin from diaper rash.
It's too soft like cotton but doesn't contain cotton. It has magic gel which is absorbe all liquid and baby feel comfortable. It's big solution of diaper rashes problem. In rainy season my baby wear diaper for whole day and night I change it time to time but he is free from rashes problem. Seriously this is  best for babies.
We generally use Pampers for our kid. But this box was not good. Every single piece leaked and leaked in the same manner - at waistline. Not happy with this box. Either this is a fake product or the quality from Pampers have degraded. Two boxes in a row that had similar problems. Have now cancelled subscription.
Nice quality Diapers for kids...
I am happy with the results of using Pampers pant style diapers.
There is no complaint of urine leaks.
"Size is perfect. Comfortable and flexible waist band, no irritation or red marks after using pampers diapers."
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
I recommend pampers diaper pants to my knowns...
I loved how soft and comfortable these diapers are. They keep my baby dry throughout the day. I use it at bedtime or when I had to go outside for the long time. It is true to it's claim and keeps baby dry for the longest time. My baby has not suffered rashes using it. I am very happy with these diapers!!! Would recommend it to all mom's!
"It was a bad experience since last two orders. Pampers has lost its glory. Its either duplicate or second quality. Doesnt even work for two hours, it starts leaking and baby has to suffer the wet ness. Poor quality  and waste of time and money."
Giving pamper to my baby is just like really its totally pampering to child no rash no itching no spots no dark shadding to skin etc.its like total care of using pamper diaper ever  though best thing is that using of pamper we don't have to use any of creams and all. It good to use pamper said to all mom....
My baby spends whole night peacefully after wearing Pampers pants &
It's the most trusted brands since ages so without a fail it's carrying on it's legacy and it passed on from my mother to me and I'm happy with it's use.
Love Pampers because my baby loves it too & is comfortable for her
"The current product delivered was of worse quality...my baby had started developing rashes within one hour of usage, diaper doesn't have any soaking capability..the item is of such a poor quality atleast 10% of the diapers could not be used since they were getting damaged on normal handling...I have ordered pampers product earlier but have not experienced such worse quality item"
"This is first time I am using pampers.earlier I was buying mamypoko pants, for which I have never faced any issue.This time the wastes are coMing out of pamper pants which is pathetic and completely unhygienic for baby.I would not go for pampers ever."
"Have been ordering Pampers from Amazon through cloudtail india seller, which was genuine;this order was provided by other seller..sigma.. which is definitely not genuine."
My baby has got rashes after using only a single diaper of this packet.
Ratings for this seller was 4.6 .. Request Amazon to verify before giving such ratings to sellers.
"Oh my pampers are life savers. I have been using this product on my baby since she was born and believe me its a boon for mothers as well as for babies. The softness, flexibility of it makes it my favourite brand. While using it I never found it leaking, or any rash on baby's skin and its absorption is commendable. Awesome product.. Love its fragrance.. Value for money. Happy baby happy mamma!"
"I am using pamper since the birth of my son..and he is 2 now...and still a daiper baby, though he pee and poops a lot...but not even a single time the pamper daiper have leaked nor spilled..plus it so soft.. doesn't even leave daiper marks or I have faced rash problem using them."
I gifted a set of diapers to my Sister for her new born baby girl. She said it is very easy to use and also very comfortable for their baby girl. She sleep well in night and their is no leakage problem at all. Overall they thanks me for such a useful gift. I think this is a safe product for new born baby skin.
"See, this time Pampers has lower down its quality a lot. Not a promising quality at all. Diaper leaks within 6-7 only even I have taken Large size diapers according to my kid's weight. I would not suggest anyone to buy this. Do not trust this brand at all. I would like to return or exchange it as it's an expensive thing."
"Since last 1 and half years, I have been buying this product and I had no complaint about the product, but this time, I the quality of the product is unimaginable. first I thought it to be improved design, but in the first use it shows its quality. But to my dismal, the new, so called improved product is awful. It leaked every nights and I. The product quality is inferior and never expected Pampers to introduce such a disappointment."
"Have been using these products from my nephew born, Excellent fit and baby smiles whenever worn. It smells really really nice, comfortable and easy to wear it even my nephew didn't have any diaper rash problem . Lasts longer and so smooth to change the pamper, does heavy duty and holds longer"
"This is not at all a good product as once the child pie in it,it starts leaking out its a very cheap quality product and very thin.i think its a duplicate product cant expect this type of product from pampers or AMAZON."
As i m a regular customer of AMAZON i expect that Amazon will replace this product.
"The quality of material use is good as rarely happened that the diaper leaked. It is very good easy put it as it a pant style diaper. The fitting is not tight over skin if you choose the right size. The only thing that has to be kept in mind is, you need to pick a larger size if you were previously using pampers. If you were using large then you will have to buy x-large."
"pampers baby dry pants are cotton like soft and contains lotion with aloe vera which protects baby skin, my baby has super sensitive skin and gets rashes easily but she didnot get any after using these diapers.. also it soaks and keeps dry for along time which is very helpful as there is no leakage which helps babies sleep peacefully entire night!"
"Quality is Bad,,,  I have used Pampers M & L which is good quality, But XL quality is very Bad in material. Always it is in leakage condition at Night. My baby is 14kg but overflow it. Don't buy XL Size Pampers."
Pathetic diapers. Very very pathetic diapers. Leaking in every second pee. I am sure these are duplicate diapers. And unfortunately no return policy. Pampersndojt play with ur name for a small amt if money
I have been using Pampers ordered from Amazon since last 2 years for my child...
But this particular consignment is fake.it does not soke at all...Generally a pamper product is good enough for the entire night
..But this product does not even last for 2 hours..My son's clothes are getting drenched...The dealer/supplier of this particular consignment should be banned from amazon..It is spoiling the name of Amazon..Probably I will not be ordering Pampers in online mode ever
The quality of Pampers has reduced and the New Air channel package is blunder from Pampers.
"If you can find the previous package Extra Absorb channels, please buy that package only."
Looks like Pampers lacks proper quality checks and is a total disappointment.
"If you are using it for babies, be ready to handle the leakages very frequently."
It is a Defective product due to wrong Design.
"Something very fishy about this pack of diapers, I have been ordering pampers for the last 3 years for two kids and This pampers size medium comes With a design that similar to size small and to the surprise even the diapers are of a smaller size than usual Medium size. The gel doidnt work properly,diapers getting torn ,and leaks in few minutes . worst experience. Don't / never recommend to buy this product"
"Do not buy this product. I am a regular customer of this product on Amazon . No doubt, Price is low than other sites but there is a reason behind. Size is reduced now. Also i have a doubt on authenticity. It is not medium sized diapers that they used to be. Disappointed."
"The diaper pants are not suitable for New borns. Wetness isn’t distributed within the whole diaper as a result back side gets filled up soon(new babies sleep on back all day), and then the diaper leaks."
The diapers gave very bad rashes to my little baby.
Pampers diapers are soft. In pack we get 20 count. Baby can wear 1 diaper whole night also its leak proof. No bad smell after removing it in morning. My baby is 1 month old these diaper size is good for him.
I have ordered  Pampers large176 pieces 15 days back. I have never scene this much worst quality from Pampers. I have been ordering since 5 years for both my babies. This is the first time that i have seen that all the pieces are very thin and easily teared. No leak proof as well. Please look in to the matter and arrange me the option to return or refund this ASAP.
Best one I have bought for my baby. 2 years now not even a single complaint so far. No allergy or rashes and one last up to 12 hours.This product alone specifically delivers in 2 days by amazon everytime and I don't know why. If they could  provide other products also at this speed it would be great.
I am writing this review on behalf of my sister as i ordered it for her baby. This is one of the best diapers available in the market and other companies does only false claims. The baby stays happy and cheerful all the time. No leaks whatsoever. Will order again as soon as this gets over.
"We are using this product for our baby from last 3-5 months, It's a great product.. Material is so soft and  no rashes."
Magic gel absorbs wetness away for up to 8 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product is a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Baby lotion with ALOE VERA helps protect baby’s delicate skin from rash and irritation
My choice 👩 Pampers...
. .
"Pampers is a very well known brand in 👶 diapers. From since our child born, doctors and all of our known suggest that 💛yellow pack new baby Pampers for your new born. But why?"
. .
There should be something na because of that everybody recommend it always...
. .
"For me, it is just like 👩. The first touch after doctors your baby get is Pampers. Yes it Pampers the baby just like a mom..."
. .
It is very soft and thin.have breathable belt and cuffs that keeps your baby fresh and aloe vera lotion to protect 👶 skin...
. .
You can purchase it from Amazon...
.
.
P. S. Helps the baby to get a goodnight sleep...
I bought these diapers with the hope of getting a genuine product which will be comfortable for my baby however when I received the product I was shocked to see the quality of the diaper it's so pathetic I cannot believe it's from Pampers as I have already used their diapers however note to all parents if u r looking for price n not comfortability of the baby then please go ahead n buy these pathetic diapers.
"I tried Pampers pants for my baby and I must it is best quality diapers, as I uesd.... It is gentle on baby's delicate skin."
It has soft stretch waist and sides.
"Present extra dry layer, all night absorbency ..... It also available in all sizes.... It reduces diapers rashes. It is easy to wear and have soft stretch waist .... Highly recommend for all babies...."
"First of all thanks to amazon for 2 days delivery in prime services. Super packing by the seller . Superb quality, leak proof,. Easy to use and change. Extremely comfortable for baby also as well as parent is tension free. Must buy for small baby. While going to travel very usefull."
I am using this from the first day my daughter was born and I started using the diapers..
They are super soft and super absorbent..
They are completely leak proof and I am in love with the fragrance  and they are the best diapersin the market
"Excellent diapers from pampers. It lasts for long time, and also without any leakage. This product is also very soft, and for that there is no rash on the skin. The absorbency is pretty good. I think this is the best diaper in the market."
I ordered this product and has been using for for my kid for the last 3 weeks I went out of station for couple of days and due to an emergency I had to buy a smaller package from a local shop the difference in quality between the product that I bought from Amazon and the product I bought from the local shop is very huge the one I bought from the locker shop was the same size but had a smaller quantity compared to the Amazon product but it had better absorbency and had better quality so when it's time to buy the next package I would definitely rethink whether I should go for the product in Amazon or whether I should buy a better quality product from a local shop
It's a great product .material is soft so no rashes and no tension too. Magic gel that locks wetness. I find this more reliable . Super thin my baby Could wear any dress over it. This diaper having a great elastic and foam quality and my baby have dry night to sleep.
I have been purchasing diapers of the same company and of same size and same quantity of packets as well from big bazaar and other super markets. But quality of this product is not same.
  Don't know why and how same multinational  company is providing different quality on different platforms
"Excellent product, it absorbs well whole night baby was wet free. Doesn't leak.buy proper size of your baby. This brand has appropriate size pampers to age and weight. It's soft doesn't leave mark on baby's skin. I loved it. Even fragrance is good doesn't smell medicine."
I have been using mamy poko pants diaper for my kid. For who changed I tried using these diapers because they were slim. Opposite to my expectations they were very unreliable. They would leak and has a very less absorption power. I had to order another packet of mamy poko pant and there is working fine. Pathetic quality buy pampers I will never use them.
As always Pampers is a very trustworthy brand so this time also it won't disappoint you. They are very comfortable for the babies and they are of good size too. They are made with such material with which air can be passed so that baby will love it.
"This is a duplicate product, I was embarrassed in public because of this product. It has 0% absorbency and 100% leaky...  I bought it for my 8 month old daughter and she kept tossing in her sleep at night because after just 6 hrs of using this thing becomes full and leaks on the bed.  Totally against what they are advertising. Don't go for this 100% leakage."
"I bought pampers diapers for my 8 month old daughter but these are the worst kind my daughter gets rash around her buttocks and vagina, previously I was using cuddles and supplies brand never had such issues, will never buy these again, u guys can check online there r lot of issues with pamper diapers in other countries too most common is rash, will never recommend to anyone , don't take even if they r providing free of cost."
Best quality diapers..material is very good absorbing capacity is very good..no leakage problem..softer than other diapers..protects the baby from any kind of rashes..it fits well and I have never faced any issues with this diapers...the baby remains dry and comfortable for a long time...highly recommended.
Pamper Active keeps baby active
1. Material is very good.
2. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
3. Absorbing capacity is very good.
4. Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal pamper diapers.
"Do not compete with Pamper premium, but this is very good."
Please do not go for normal pamper diapers because there are lots of complains about its quality.
"Hope this review will help to all of you. Once you use it, you will not find any word of this review wrong."
"Think this was a duplicate item. I was using normal diapers earlier which were good, but these diaper pants are pathetic. It starts to leak in 4 to 5 hours. The quality is so bad that u can see the colour of the stool! The baby got rashes as well. The seller is either selling a duplicate product or Pampers (P&G) have manufactured a product of very bad quality. Will never buy it again and also suggest others not to buy it."
"I had been using baby dry diapers ever since my lo was born now that she is 13 months old I thought I should switch to pant style diapers, with my trust n loyalty with pampers I opted for the pampers baby dry pants but was so disappointed with them result it gets shifted every now &then and there is leakage always when my baby is sleeping this is irritating me never faced this with Their baby dry range !! Poor absorbency and not at all leakproof and the worst it with due respect for the brand I ordered 4jumbo pack already which has no return policy my bad 👎🏻 Not recommended at all"
Duplicate see my image u will understand
ORGINAL
1.BIG AND GREEN COLOUR (bought from local shop)
DUPLICATE( bought from AMAZONE
1. POOR QUALITY
2. SMALL THAN ORGINAL
3.XL IS WRITTEN BELOW FRONT LABEL
4. HARD THAN ORGINAL
Its not real product. Leaks very fast. I am using pampers since2 years for my baby. But now the last 3 lots was duplicate.very bad quality. I am going to replace pampers with some other brands
The New series of diaper pants launched by pampers are smaller in size as compared to prior ones of same size which were available till recently. They seem to be tighter and are uncomfortable. It is time for pampers to change its motto from one diaper a night to two-three diapers a night.
Material is very good. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
Absorbing capacity is very good.
Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal diapers
Nice product....it gives less rashes as compare to other diapers.
Pamper pants is soft and best diaper to use for new born babies. This product(NB size) is very comfortable for new born babies and it keeps baby dry all night.
I would highly recommend this product.
Tried other popular brands but leakage and comfort is not like pampers. Also on amazon you can get 20-30% discount on MRP which is great thing as in market no discount.
Have been using pampers for my baby from his birth.
Had always doubt about using diapers for small babies as I was scared of rashes.. But thankfully with pampers never had any problems... Baby slept comfortably and I was relaxed too.
Diapers quality is very good and comfortable for my twin daughters. There is no rashes or skin reaction. Absorbs wetness and soft for baby skin. Works for whole night without any leakage. Thanks amazon for fast delivery and pampers for taking care of my daughters.
Best diaper ever for babies. Very comfortable and soft can be use for overnight light weight does not leak.
This product is a awesome... Baby sleeps properly overnight... So much silky and soft.. No leakage and no rashes. I recommend this product just go for it. Great product in reasonable price...and happy with amazon for super fast delivery.
My honest review on this 👍
"M using pampers since my baby 👶 born, & trust me its the best, i mean sometimes i thought go for some different brands available on market, but lastly i can't change my thoughts againsts pampers! 💗 Means pampers all the way! & lastly don't forget to buy it from Amazon .. Great deal!!! Awesome price range! Obviously less from the market :) ❤️"
"My son is 11 mints old and I used this company product for the first time, this Doesn't have any absorbency, gets leak within 4 hours and we need to change the diaper twice in a night......"
Please don't buy it as this is not with random pieces of diapers this is with each diaper in the pack
Really disappointed with the product....
Will never buy it in future and will recommend everyone not to go for it either
Old  was better.  Need to change diaper after two time use. Night diaper will not go till morning... Many times I observed my baby dress full wet because of leaking and bad absorption. I was not expecting this from pamper.
I purchased this for my nephew who is 4 months old. I was happy to see that pampers did not cause rashes to his skin. It absorbs wetness very quickly and does not irritate him. It can carry 3 kg load and still does not sting. Its soft and high quality.
I am really grateful to my friend for suggesting me to use Pampers New Diapers Pants for my baby. Earlier he used to cry whole night due to wetness but Pampers New Diaper Pants helps him to stay dry and he enjoys sound sleep. It keeps the baby free from rashes.
"Very bad diper, I have just used 2-3 diper but not satisfied, if you can see in photo this is material which is out of diper and blow on baby's bump, very bad this time, i hope this complaint will effect because this is for my baby and I will never buy this and also for other."
"I have used pampers diaper brands for my baby ,some brands  are good in absorbency, some are soft but all of them are not comfortable to the baby so after trying so many brands i found out this is very good diaper excellent absorbing capacity and its very comfortable for my baby while sleeping. i am ordering this large pack for about 3 years( of course size has changed since from zero to XL for my baby). also some brands leave marks on your baby skin but this diaper does not have any such problem only key point here is choosing your baby size correctly. it is good for 6-8 hours in an extended run."
Pampers are my first choice for my babies... It is so soft... Totally leak proof... I use them on a daily basis... Full night 12 hours... No leakage... No rashes on my baby's skin... No matter if I use it 24 hours too... No redness no irritation nothing happens.... My baby stays happy happy in pampers....
i am using pampers since 1.5 years. i always order mega monthly box pack of 152. they comes in 38x4=152 total pack. they were of excellent quality.(they use to have extra absorb channel logo on it.  but right now i received in pack of 76x2=152. with logo of air channel. each and every pack licks and don't even last for 2 hours. waste of money so don't buy. if you don't sell the original product you use to have for sale we will have to switch to other brand.
I have been using pamper pants for my 6 months old little one and it's absolutely soft and leak proof. I have tried some other brands before using pampers but I consider it be the best. Pampers contains aloe vera which prevents baby's skin from rashes. Pamper gives us happy and sleep-full Nights. Seriously!!
Pampers is my go-to product for baby diapers. It absorbs well and keeps the baby's/toddler skin dry & rash free. I like it more because it's design is leak proof even for my active toddler. I've used it for my new born too because of the soft touch. Totally recommend it !
it’s a nice pants..! Material of this pants are soft so it’s not causing any type of rashes on baby’s delicate skin. New design of this product has a feature of comfortable fit. Magic gel locks wetness away for up to hours and hours. quality of this product is appreciated.
"These pampers were absolute beauties, fit and quality wise. Super thin, my baby could wear any dress over it, frocks, pants, rompers, anything and everything looked trim, no trace of the diaper being seen from outside. Lasts overnight as well, flat 10-12 hours."
These pants causes rashes very quickly. I would recommend Pampers active baby diapers or Pampers baby dry diapers instead.
Diaper pants locks moisture with baby's skin and causes rash very quickly n frequently.
"Pumpers is the brand which doesn't need any explanation, easy to use, comfortable on baby skin, no rashes problem, it's keep skin dry overnight. It's Aloevera lotion helps to keep baby skin rash free and irritation free, it's gives up to 12 hour of dryness."
"Pampers diapers are best for kids as they are leak proof ,rash free and comfortable to wear."
They are super absorbent and even if they are full they don’t become become heavy like other diapers.I am happy to finally find perfect diapers for my kid
love these as over night diapers! Even for every day use they're great. They're soft and comfortable for my daughter which makes her happy her being happy makes me happy. Also they keep her dry over night so no waking up because of a wet diaper.
This was definitely very low quality diapers compared to what I usually buy at the shops or other sites. It even looked so fake. The ID code which is printed on the main cover was not present on the individual diapers which led me to believe these were indeed fake Pampers product. It kept leaking every night  and sometimes even after just 2 or 3 hrs.  Will definitely  not re order from Amazon again.
Excellent quality and flexible to baby's movements for comfortable fit.
Easy to wear and comfortable during night because it creates space for air to flow.
It's durability is high and it is soft on skin for a comfortable night sleep.
It's best diaper other than because of aloe vera lotion which protects from skin rash and irritation.
"Absorbance 👍Softness 👍Leak proof👍Comfortably fit👍 as shown in the add, it is actually last upto 12 hours and the Magic gel technology helps to keep baby dry for longer and the best part is lotion with Aloe Vera which protect skin from rashes.."
"If your baby is not so healthy, then this is the perfect fit. Mamypoko pants are a bit wider, hence it creates a problem in walking for the kids that are not so healthy."
"Recently I picked these up and they are wonderful! I wouldn't have thought before I was a parent that diapers would be worth feeling excited about but after many leaks and endless search this diaper is worth the praise.They are soft, very absorbent and fits great.These diapers provide up to 12 hours of leak-proof protection & are super soft with a snug fit waist band which helps to keep baby dry and comfortable.Totally love these diapers."
"I am a pampers mom since last 2yrs. The improvements in material, durability and easy-to-use are best in class. The aloe Vera lotion gives extra smoothness to the baby's skin. The airy, soft and easy to tear waist band is a win win. As it is not very tight on babies skin and the easy tear sides help in removing the soiled diaper with convenience."
"New Pampers Baby-Dry pants style diaper I use it for my baby, this product pampers is really good i order this product for my daughter she is approx 18 months old. It is a great product. Material is very soft and important is no rashes, material is very skin friendly. It is comfortable, fit and hugs my baby’s skin. My life is easier because we no longer have to deal with any skin reactions or rashes and my baby is comfortable. Its gel locking system is amazing, it locks the wetness for more than 10 hrs and keep my baby dry entire night. I highly recommend this product."
"My first time purchase for my new baby and I must say, this is one of the best decision I have taken for my kid. Pampers is as soft as a feather on baby's bum even after 12 hours. Yes, it comes out as dry, the pee soaked in, absolutely no smell and there is no skin wrinkle."
"I have 1 baby and I am using pampers  for my baby. It’s really soft and comfortable for baby soft and sensitive skin. One diaper lasts for whole night, no rashes or allergies seen since I am using it earlier and then now ordered just because of well known quality of this superb"
"Diapers are very poor in quality. Absorption capacity is very less. It is leaking in 2-3 hours. It is not the original pamper diapers. Amazon to take action on their sellers who are selling duplicate products. I am regular customer of amazon. Because of this , duplicate product, now I have doubt about amazon. I hope amezon will do the needful to maintain their brand and customer trust."
I have bought Pampers New Diapers Pants first time from Amazon for my nephew and I was totally happy with the bundle conveyed to me. So far I couldn't find any problem. I prefer pampers because any other brand gave a horrible rash. Don’t know why people are giving negative reviews.
I've been using Pampers diaper pants for my kids for a long time and really love how gentle they are on baby's skin. The Pampers are best for night time use and have absorbency upto 7-8 hrs. They have aloe vera lotion which helps in keeping baby's skin soft and rash free! Recommend this for all new borns and babies!
I bought this one for my son and its so comfortable after wear it by son..  very useful as I want for my son.. Good packaging and arrived on time..
Its a very good product and material is skin friendly. I am using this product since long for my baby and till now my baby didnt suffer from or any other skin related issues or any rashesh. This diaper is awesome to absorb the liquid also and gives extra absorption and ofcourse last more than 10 hrs. I am very much satisfied with the product.
My baby is 2 yr old now. Am using pampers from his birth. I have purchased pampers through Amazon many times. But this time am not satisfied with the product I received. It looks like a duplicate. There's some difference in appearance. But it does its job..
I'm a happy mother with pamper diapers because before 8 months I'm blessed with a baby boy. In starting time we didn't use any diapers because I heard from many people that with diaper baby is not feeling good and scared with rashes problem and I didn't sleep whole night with my son wet napy problem. After some time I used many others diapers. But not satisfied with quality as  compared to Pamper Diaper. With use pampers my baby sleep whole night and wake with smile and  i never faced any rashes issues. So definitely I'm happy mother with pamper diaper.
I guess first of all it duplicate and expired product that you are selling bcz 1diaper =1 night nonsense according to me 1diaper =2 hrs that too its leaking and poor quality when compate with poko pants and huggies are much better than pampers
Pampers is the Brand every parents can trust while buying baby product. The pants are so soft and easy to use and remove It make my baby feel comfortable.
It locks all the wetness and it's fitting is really good the baby can feel more comfortable in it. And there is no rashes after using pampers diaper the aloe vera gel is really good for the skin of the babies. This new upgraded version of the product is really good.
Fresh product according to showing in the description
 i think this one is the best and comfortable for my  little brother thank you  pampers.😀
"Using pamper pants for my kid for last 3 years. Complete satisfaction. Much better than Huggies or mamy poko pants. They hardly stay dry for longer period. But pampers has tested and proven to us, it keeps dry and absorb better."
It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too..
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body"
Baby lotion with aloe vera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Pampers , the name says it all.  Its all about pampering  ur baby with wonderful dry pants. Very easy to use and leak proof. They are super cottony and comfortable.. i am a reguĺar user of pampers and trust me they are the best and lasts long. Baby stays so comfortable in them . This brand will never break your trust."
"I have been using Pampers for the past year for my daughter. It's been mostly ok, but lately I have observed that it rips from the back and the absorbent stuff spills out. This is a danger factor as the child could ingest these absorbent particles. The attached picture is after a night of use ~9 hours."
"It never disappoints me. Can rely upon it wherever I take my baby, weddings, doctor visits of crèche. Optimum Absorption and great quality, diaper rash is no problem. The new diapers with aloe vera are quite skin friendly and airy. one diaper lasts through night and there is no leakage in morning. Did not have such great experience with other diaper brands."
"Absolutely Amazing product 👍 I have been regularly ordering these for my 9 month niece. The diapers are really super soft, comfortable and easy to use. 😊 Best part they are leak proof and water absorbency is very good 👍 must buy product"
Good quality 👍 and durability
1. Material is very good.
2. No leakage unless baby sleeps on one side for long hours.
3. Absorbing capacity is very good.
4. Compare to Huggies and other brands even it is far far better than normal pamper diapers.
"Do not complete with Pamper premium, but this is very good."
Please do not go for normal pamper diapers because there are lots of complains about its quality.
"Hope this review will help to all of you. Once you use it, you will not find any word of this review wrong."
"We have been ordering pampers almost 3 years. The quality of the material delivered this time is not really pampers. I guess some cheap quality material has been supplied this time. Diaper pant are not soft, durable, flexible etc. Hope this is not repeated and trust we have on Amazon is intact."
"Pampers is a very renowned diaper brand and undoubtedly one of the best. What I liked about these diapers was the soft inner lining so that the baby doesn't feel harsh. Also, one diaper last for around 6-7 hours through the night! The soaking capacity is great! Plus the pants are easy to use and the waist area is very soft so it doesn't create impressions on the baby's skin.  I recommend using these."
"This product is too useful for both baby and mother as it gives relaxation with sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 152 units , each consists of air channels which provides dryness whole night ."
most comfortable product with long lasting leakage free protection for my child.... Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good
"If weight is accounted, the online pampers are very much light and use too less padded material to soak, in comparison to those available in market. I was happy to see the price difference, as online was too cheap, but surely after use, realised the product quality is cheap as well. Might be that I am missing some ** of (condition applied)...or if that is how it is"
Unhappy to buy online.
"These new pampers diaper pants are really amazing! ✅ I bought these for my niece who is 6months old, it fits perfect and is so comfortable. They are made with good material and are really soft 💯 Good absorbency and best part is that they are leak proof. 👍"
used to buy this pampers premium care diapers online as they are low priced compared to store bought ones.. Everytime it starts leaking within few hours of use.. But recently i purchased this same pampers small size diapers in a store for the MRP rate it is of very good quality in fitnesz absorption and softness.. If you are compromising the quality of the product for your discounts then u should inform the customers as such.. This is too bad
We are using pamper pants since day 1.We are so happy to use them for our baby. We don’t have to worry about rashes and my baby as well as my wife sleep full night as there is no tension of leakage too. I would recommend all parents to use pampers.
I have ordered L size daiper pants with 128 counts. I opened the box today and there are  xl size daipers(56) count in box. ...i have ordered many times but all time i received right order but this time cloudtell deleverd wrong size and also less daipers. The total of 112 diapers inside the box. The complete box is waste for me now
"Oh God.. they don’t have a return policy.. while purchasing check for the return policy..  it says for newborns. The baby is a new born and still it’s tight, I don’t know why this is tight for the new borns..  won’t recommend to friends or family and to everyone who is interested in this product."
It is a nice product.. Material is soft so no worry of rash.
Magic gel locks wetness away to keep the baby dry.
Flexible waist band that adapts to baby’s movements for a comfortable fit
Plz keep on using aloe vera gel that would help protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation
"Would not buy again , I used to buy a popular brand and  I bought pampers  monthly pack for the first time ,  The diaper is elastic  and looks small for a XL size ,due to that air flow is less and creating rashes for the baby.I had to then  go for the previous brand  and I lost my 1000 rs on buying this pampers."
"This product is like Vardaan for both baby and mother as it gives continous sleep to both . I got this from Amazon at very low cost . It has around 64 units , each consists of air channels which provides dryness whole night . Highly comfortable and fit . It has Flexible waist that adapts to baby’s movements . Each unit has Aloe Vera lotion that protects baby’s delicate skin from rashes and irritation . Overall quality is too good . I got this delivered in just within 2-3 days . It was nicely packed and sealed ."
Huge disappointment with this online product. Keep leaking
When I buy the same product from shop physically then it's perfectly fine but online product is not good.
Not recommend to buy online
"This is pathetic diaper i ordered till now. My daughter daily wakes up with wet night suit. One day i checked at 3AM, night suit was wet. I used to use pampers active baby, just tried pants as they are advertising it more frequent. But my decision was wrong. I advise all parents to stay away from this pathetic diapers"

It is a great product. Very soft Material so no rashes and no tension too..

Very nice product.i like it.If u wanna think about Best quality diapers its Pampers.. i have used any brands.. but i stand for pampers as it is leak free.. rash free.. soft cotton.. nice material used around waist.. which make baby more comfortable.. love for pampers
Pampers baby-dry pants diapers are with new air channels providing baby a new type of dryness overnight.
These diaper pants are super soft and doest give any kind of rashes also to baby.
Satisfied .
Pampers has been my first and only choice for my son.  It has never disappointed me for my choice.  The daiper is so good and soft.  It stay for good hour with any leakage.  Definitely recommend to all moms for great daiper experience.
"Pampers Platinum Pants’ comes with unique adjustable side tapes. a snug fit provides better leakage protection. I think this exclusive feature to pamper Pants is awesome, considering babies come in all shapes and sizes with comfort"
I'm using pampers for my both babies since 3 years but this time i try
"New pampers premium pants with new, improved cotton like softness.."
It's Wetness indicator is awwsoommee which turns from yellow to blue when it may be time to change.
It also Infused with mild lotion to help protect your baby’s delicate skin from irritation.
"The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my toddler's delicate skin. It is a great product.. Material is soft so no rashes and no tension too. Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness. best part is Baby lotion with aloevera helps protect your baby’s delicate skin from diaper rash and irritation."
"Good Diaper, but it leaves a mark on baby's waist.Elastic is too tight . Company should provide soft elastic, and they should keep it in mind, these products will come in direct contact with babies. Like other diapers, req change after every 4 - 5 hours."
Mamypoko pants are far far better than this
.... My baby got rashes and res skin and itching problem... We returns it immediately
Its absorbing power is not good and in 5 hours only it starts leaking.
"However, it is very soft and good for babies, but if diaper will resist for only 5 hour and will become heavy then it would be very costly."
"Its a fake copy , rashes on baby skin , even the size is not da same as other unit and best part no return policy .. you are selling fake products via amazon .."
I know there is no return policy but i can ask amazon to cancel your fake bazaar.
"I was using some other brand's diaper, but was facing leakage problem and rashes.. so I tried Pampers n I am totally satisfied with the results.. one pamers is enough for whole night.. and no rashes because of aloe vera lotion it contains.. so I am happy with Pampers.."
"Best than other brands out there with more absorbing time, odour free, comfortable leaves no rashes or any sign of diaper elastic and so on. Pretty thin also you wont be able to notice when put clothes on your baby over the diaper. I could not ask for more, peaceful nights for me more than my child."
I have been this product when my baby born. It is very comfortable. Not a single time my baby face my skin issue. Quality is excellent. I have not tried any other product it's so comfortable. Good part is that it's available in all sizes. My baby was underweight when he born still I could get his size Since then I am being a loyal customer for this product. All mother should try and test this product and am sure you will not go for any other product
The Main thing in Pampers is it has Capabilities of Stopping leakage full night . The Soft cotton material which is present and the Pleasant smell is Osm. It's lotion with Aloevera is Amazing it gives parents a good Fresh environment. It's Magic Gel formula Interact more people toward it to use for her child that make it differ from the other Baby dry pants.its in budget for Every Category of parent.
Its too light in weight but baby got so many rashes so i personally dont like it for my baby.
We are using huggies and mamy poco but never felt with such problem.
First time tried best brand pamper but not satisfied may be its only happened with my baby and others satisfied.
My baby was born underweight only 1500gms
And to gain wt it was must to provide him best hygiene
Pampers helped me like a blessing
My mother also remarked
"""Kash humare jamane me hota"""
Thnks to pampers 4 giving me and my baby peaceful nights
Its a myth dat diapers cause rashes
Rashes r caused due to unhygenic way of using it
Before using diapers one should know d process of keeping clean intimate area of baby
"We tried many other brands, premium diapers, pants and what not before we tried this and haven't changed it since then. In case of our baby, regular diapers gave him rashes and pampers premium won't last more than a couple of hours. These pants are comfortable and last the entire night for our 10 months old. But with diapers, always try with a smaller pack before taking the plunge as each baby is different."
I am using pampers for my baby and I am happy with the results.
 
Till now never had the problem of urine leaks.
It helps a lot during the nights or on long journeys.
Good material used in diapers which keeps baby dry and active all the time.
" Flexible waistband is very comfortable for the kid, it doesn't leaves any marks."
I am very happy and impressed with pampers diaper pants and recommend this to all looking out for diapers
When you have twins the diapers are handy thing with this super absorbent and leak proof diapers are life saver.
Also using diapers first thing comes is softness and with pampers you will rest assured the baby is in good condition and stay hygiene and dry
"I have used pampers for my son and now i am using for my daughter. Pampers are soft, absorbent, and leak proof diapers. It prevents rashes and keeps skin softer. And it doesn't get heavier even after use of 8 hrs."
"At first I used Huggies diapers which is more expensive than pampers.but when I get the best offers from Pampers so I bought this item.and I realise it's more comfortable for my baby.it is very good quality , durable and easy to use.and rashes is gone away."
After trying a huge variety of diaper brands I have stuck to this one. Awesome fitting leakage proof and of course no complaints about the absorbency. Also the material is so light that skin can breath easily. Additionally this 144 number packet serves the entire month. But
Awesome product...i was affraid to buy the product online as heared issues of genuine product... when i opened the package i have doubted that the diaper seems bery low weight than i baught from the supermarket. So i tested it by dropping water from the water pipe and it was awesome experience that all the waters were absorbed and there was no leak...
"The best diapers available in the market. With the pleasant aloe Vera odour, pampers outperform compared to other products. Searched a lot on child diapers, and finally i found the fact that pampers is the ultimate destination of all parents to care their little ones"
Pampers xl pants are a good product.
It's has enough absorption to last overnight
And doesn't get too messy even if the child defecates in it.
"Easy to put on and remove, overall a good product with good value for money."
Ever since my baby is born I didn't trust any brand except pampers.  It's so good and I never face leakage problem.  My son is a proud pamper baby.
It even doesn't cause rashes even if used for longer time.
"I have been buying this big pack as they are giving good discounts. But recently I have started watching some negative reviews about this product having quality issues and it's durability. But I didn't face any issues like this. There was no leakage and quality was good, maybe not great but isn't bad too. Maybe it might be one of the case for some people where they didn't get the right product."
Magic gel that locks wetness away for up to 12 hours of dryness
"The new and improved product design enables a comfortable fit, closer to the baby’s body. My baby is very comfortable in pampers. I will buy it again."
I ordered Pamper diapers for my one year 3 months old son.
"After using so many different brands i recommend this to every parent because pampers diapers designed to keep your baby dry and comfortable. Its super stretchy elastic adapts to the baby’s waist size to give a gentle, comfortable fit. And it provides up to 12 hours absorption for uninterrupted play and sleep time for your baby. "
Pamper pant  quality is very good . Fittings are nice and  very easy to use. Its price on Amazon is much lower than the market rate. Material is soft which help to  no rashes .its magic gel help dryness 12 hrs leakage free. The brand pamper is trustable. Value of money .
"This diaper is of poor quality. Material is thin and it leaks. Now that we have opened it after two weeks and used four pants so far, I am not returning it but this is waste of money.  Amazon and the seller selling substandard product promoting it as premium product at premium price."
"Diapers are very soft, i love the material and its fits well to my baby, after i started use it on my baby boy he stopped getting diaper rashes, the diaper is best to use in night, very happy with the product...."
recommended...
"Pampers pants is very nice product for baby's. Pampers Pants absorbency is best , 1 night full dry for baby,  it is leak proof because it is made from best cotton,  and nice softness . Overall  best pants for bebys .variant types of pants size like s , m , l ,XL, xxl ."
Good and genuine item received. Bought it several times from Amazon. Price less compared to offline retailers.
Baby boy also seems happy with it!
Good absorbing capacity. We typically need 2 per day.
wow it helped me a lot & saved my shopping time
It was amazing product 😊  very easy to use nd stuff quality is awesome ..
I want to suggest everyone to buy this product for your baby  .... after using this i will shop again tq amazone to provide this product 😊
Nice daiper with high absorbing capacity...
Its very soft than others...
Great deal in comparison of local market.
"Small size does not fit for 3months baby. It only fit for 0-2 months. For above 3months, I would prefer medium size. Ensure the pants are checked n changed every 2-3hours. Although it cover say one pant = one night, babies are unconfortable once the pant is heavy."
"My daughter is 11 months old, recently I used pampers diapers for the first time, and I would like to say,  it is a very good product, it protects the baby from any kind of rashes,  fits quite well around the waist and is leak proof even if baby urinates, or worns it for a longer period. Additionally,  it is very light weighted, softness at its peak and not overly fragranced."
"Cherry on cake is, even after having all these attributes, it is pocket friendly also."
Ordered for my nephew and niece as my family prefers this brand.
Apparently they are very satified with it's quality and absorbancy.
Also got a good price for lightning deal which makes me happier
Pamper diaper pants are very soft. I loved the material and fit of the diaper. The diaper is best to use during night. It keeps dry and also soft for the babies. It's anti leak quality is  what I like the most. Totally recommend to mommies to try this on babies.
It is the best one for babies. It absorption capacity is enough to stay all nigh. My baby wakes up with a smile on his face. It is ssoo soft as baby doesnt cry once while wearing it. I am totally satisfied with it.
Using this product more than 9 months. Earlier it's quality and material was fine but now it's less durable and material quality is of not good quality also new packs seems less authentic. It's more like a scrap now.
"Was using Huggies without any issues. As pampers was a good brand and as it was available for offer, i tried this. But i regret buying this as it is not lasting at all. We have to change the baby at the middle of the night as it starts leaking and make the bed wet. I'd rather leave the baby without a diaper than using this."
Now i am stuck up with this as i have to wait till its over to move back to Huggies.
"I have used Pampers many a times for my baby... This time I ordered large size for her,,these diapers are really awesome 🤗as it makes my daughter comfortable throughout the day.😎... She keeps on playing the whole day without any leakage problem. 👌👌"
I just love pamper diaper and wipes too
With comparison to poko pants  its not great becoz poko pants also a good product for daily use just bcoz of price difference all people can not prefer to use it so i hope to u for give us some offer in small package
I have ordered these diapers for my nephew. the quality of the diapers is really good. It can last for a long time and its leak proof and have a good holding capacity. The size is also comfortable and its soft.
Product quality is very good .
"I have used other brands of diapers but till now pampers is the best. It's soaking capacity is amazing works whole night for my baby who is 4 months old, it is comfortable and does not create any rashes and irritation.. due to its flexible waistband baby feels comfortable."
Fittings are great and it is also very easy to use.
This diaper brand is the best in the market. I used almost every brands but now I continue with pamper diapers only because it doest not leak very often and my baby feels comfortable all day long with this diaper. Now I cannot switch with other brand .. Thanks Amazon for great deal..
Soft like feather ...Pampers has been the companion for both my kids ...I have been an ardent fan for Pampers since long time ...amazing soaking capacity...and totally leakproof ... so never had those do called sleepless nights ...All thanx to Pampers 😊
"I have bought Pampers diaper for my Son, the diaper is very soft compared to other competitors. The diaper sustain for more than 8 hours and also does not emulate bad odour. The pants are very easy to use, and the elastic around the waist is much more gentle, by not leaving impressions on my son delicate skin. On the whole I am very much satisfied with the quality of the product and also the pricing of it. I would always recommend to go for Pamper diapers."
Very soft pants with very comfortable waistline as compared to others  brands no rashes appears after using pampers hence recommended. I have been purchased this 1st time really satisfied. Good quality and long lasting
Pampers as the name is a brand. It's material is really soft and good absorbent. It's fits perfectly to the baby. And easy to remove too. These are really good as they don't cause rashes to the baby.
"Pamper pants is the best diaper that I have been using for my baby. This one I ordered to gift a friend of mine. Pampers pants have the best absorbency, they are leakproof and soft on the baby's skin."
"From past 4 years I am using pampers for by kid,those days pampers are very good for absorbing and now a days ""new pampers"" was very waste product it was not having absorbing capacity and also leaking in the nights.so,please care for kids sensitive skin and maintain the older days quality."
These are our favorite diapers. We tried a different very popular brand but Pampers are better. The baby is dry and feels comfortable. No leaking. Good product and a very reasonable price. Best value for diapers.
"i have been using this particular diapers since it was introduced at amazon...at first i wasnt very much impressed with the size covering the babys bottom...but now i find it the most cost effective,easy to use and available in market"
"This is definitely fake, not even close to the quality of the original. Very thin and not so soft. I think it must be uncomfortable for the child. It was such a cheap Quality, we had to throw them away."
"Pampers the well known brand for baby diapers, I always prefer pampers diapers for my baby, because it's safe and soft for baby's skin, comfortable, easy to wearing and gives full protection. It's my no. 1 choice."
If u wanna think about Best quality diapers its Pampers.. i have used any brands.. but i stand for pampers as it is leak free.. rash free.. soft cotton.. nice material used around waist.. which make baby more comfortable.. love for pampers
"We have a 3 year old who wears this only at night. Even if he doesn’t drink any fluid before. Sleeping, the absorbency of this nappy is not at par with some of the others, even the pampers (same size) available in a different country (UK)."
