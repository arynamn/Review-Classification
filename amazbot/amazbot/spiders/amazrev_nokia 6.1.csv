Review
Build Quality is Very Premium looking.
Compact Design. Fingerprint Sensor very Fast responsive.
Camera Performance Decent.
6+64 GB variant already updated Android Pie 9
Nice Experience 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Camera not up to mark
No worry Happy with your  Purchase and good brand quality
"Very good product. I have used almost every brand the last 4 or 5 years but at Last I feel myself ""I'm back to my home after a very long journey"". Best built quality, best camera(but use gcam), very nice design, perfect size, nice display, very good performance. Snapdragon 636 from nokia is far faster n better in all respect than a Snapdragon 660AIE processor of Xiaomi mi à2 or Redmi note 7s or 7. I use both these phones and I'm talking exactly what I experience practically in real life. Moreover the 48mp camera from redmi note 7pro is incomparable with Nokia's 16mp while using Gcam. Even older Nokia 6.1(non plus model) beats the camera of note 7 pro both front and rear. I suggest don't even hope to bring note7 pro's gimmick 48mp near nokia 6.1plus. Everything is perfect with this phone. But the battery life will be a deal breaker for many of the our youths as they will charge twice a day(PUBG!!!!). That's why I'm reducing one 🌟. But for me it's quite easy to manage for one day usage as I previously use iPhone 7. I don't know why many costumers  in amazon are ruining this very good phone. They have made change many people's minds so that they(many people) left this Nokia 6.1plus from the best seller (Apario) of amazon for an alternative phone. I suggest this phone to everyone. Don't go wrong, don't trust these ill reviews and comments. Just buy and try one you won't feel repentant."
Best mobile in that price
There was a stock Android and there
Package headphone in that
All over. Mobile was best
Very good performance and happy with this purchase. 🙂🙂🙂
"I got it for 11999 on prime day it worths more than that, lovely camera and performance no doubt with sd636 and too good ram management,I dont know why some people are not liking it but its damn good"
Nokia should just shut shop now. Going to return this piece of crap
I earlier had iphone 5s with just 5 MP camera. The photos taken by that phone are much much better than this 12 MP phone. Please donot buy this phone if you take lot of photos from phone.
Unfortunately I can't return it now. :(
At the price of Rs 11999/- I got 6 gb ram with
USB-C decent camera with smooth performance . Experienced no lad in heavy gaming and hd video playback ... overall awesome phone
"Dislike because Quality is not good. I tried to return nokia 6.1 plus mobile phone but amazon saying the electronic items are not returnable. Please purchase through other online shopping like flipkart  snapdeal etc don't purchase through amazon. If you are interested to purchase/buy any electronic items like mobile phone, laptop etc. Please go for other shopping site like flipkart not purchase through Amazon  i am unappy because i selected the amazon online shopping and purchase a mobile phone of nokia 6.1 plus 6gb ram but i don't like this mobile phone be cause it is small in size . Front Camera. Photo Quality is not good in night time or in low light time. The rear camera is also like same. One more things when you are taking picture in room the photo quality is not coming good as per mentioned 16 mega pixel camera. When you take the photo outside the picture quality is really good . The mobile is hitting to much when you compare with other mobiles like samsung vivo oppo ."
Worst phone
"Its absolutely rubbish to update system file of 1306 MB & even after updated system file  twice, its showing repeated error ""couldn't update Installation problem"""
Mobile Phone Nokia 6.1 plus
VERY SAD  WE HAVE OPEN BOX YESTERDAY NIGHT 11:30AM BUT TILL TIME DID NOT UPDATE APP AND WHATSAPP ...
Super good phone fast phone
"We got Nokia 6.1 mobile a week back. It has lot of heating issue, touch is a terrible experience."
"Its not worth our money at all. Very disappointed with Amazon services as well, we are trying to place return request couple of times but no response."
We will want to escalate this issue to next level
I have purchased this move phone at the lowest price .
"But the issue is after using 5 to 6 hours it is automaticly switche off, I have purchased 3 mobile phone every one is getting , diffrent type of issue."
I think this phone has some quality issue that's why Amozone sale it in lowest price.
"Perfect blend of craftsmanship and durability, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a gr8 device indeed."
"I got it for 12k (6/64gb variant). A really handy device, thought the 3050 mAh battery may seem a little underwhelming but the device makes the most out of it, and runs for  day and a half at moderate usage."
"One more thing, if you are having second thoughts regarding the front panel bottom branding chin and are planning to abandon this device then that is a very bad idea, cuz once u get it in your hand this device is a TRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER and looks really premium."
Not able to start mobile since unpacking of box 2days before. Request to take back the mobile.
I have a bad experience. This mobile came to me without software.
"After switching on mobile, it is asking for ""system update download""."
"Through WiFi when download completes, it says INSTALLATION PROBLEM."
And this is not working and I'm unable to use it because it's not starting.
Awesome phone. I have used xiomi vivo but nothing to beat NOKIA and it's quality. It's still the best. Very handy mobile. Also you get earphones with it which most of the companies have stopped giving.
"Guys, do not risk to buy this product.As I received a totally defective product.It was getting over heated while charging ,also was getting hanged.The most important thing is it was not accepting the pin I had set and the phone is not getting reset with the command.The command window is no available at all."
"I was having Nokia 6.1 4gb ram and 64 GB memory storage, with 6.1 plus Nokia dropped it's hardware quality , and after having 6gb ram performance degraded as compared to 4gb ram Nokia 6.1"
excellent
"This phone is perfect and serves the purpose since there is more of calling and whatsapp usage only.. I am happy with the performance of the phone.. On time delivery and received sealed box.. overall good experience with flipkart, seller and nokia"
Another premium product from Nokia. Build quality and looks are superb. Stock android with clean interface not like customised android interfaces with adds. Bagged this amazing deal during prime days. Overall experience of the phone is awesome In this price band. Thanks amazon for delivering in a day almost. Hats off.
"Great phone and highly handy, fits well in the hand. Camera is good and battery lasts for about a day and half. Nokia is really good still"
First of all the overview of the product
"In one word it's ""CLASSY PREMIUM"" THE CLASS AND METALIC WAS DAMN SEXY!"
The second thing is performance !
"I have been all end games and still I haven't found single lag....in one it's ""BUTTERSMOOTH CREAMY"" AND IT NEVER MAKE U TO FEEL LIKE ANY LAG OR HANG ISSUE! ITS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR GAMERS!"
NEVER MIND ABOUT HEATING ISSUE BECAUSE ITS NOT ISSUE ! Wheb we do multitasking or when we play games after 2 hour the battery and the board starts to heat to produce more energy...some mobiles panel won't show it out and it's glass made back door so it reflects it transparently and that is safe ! Becaus it's not storing the head inside and within 2 to 5 minutes it come to normal temperature and some brand spoilers post like battery issue and heating issue and please don't trust it if u trust it a single common heat also seems to be like heavy one!
BATTERY BACKUP AND PERFORMANCE!
I was really happy about the battery backup because I can see that I can use upto 10 hours on screen and upto 2 or 3 days on idle! And the charging was flawless and awesome ! It fully charged when device is on are 1hour 40 minutes but when the mobile is switched off it takes 2.23 hours to charge...I mean the quick charge works when mobile turnd on only!
Try 18w charger for better battery life!
"In one word it's ""AWESOME JUICE TO DRINK FIR WHOLE DAY""!"
CAMERA CLEARITY
"I was excited that the image which I shooted in perfect lighting and perfect balance was nearly 25 mb! And it's crisp and clear awesome picture which I can see details everything! Inever seen such type of clear picture in a mobile camera! But! At the low light it's damn worst ever camera and the reason is not hardware ! It's because of software ! Soon it will be solved because ""IN THUS WORLD THERE ARE BI PERFECT PHONE IN ANY RANGE"" So don't expect more from any mobile!"
"Overall it's a best steal and awesome stuff ever at this price range ,it's unimaginable"
Just go for it!
"I've used the phone for almost a month now. Would certainly not recommended it for gaming due to heating issues and battery drain.. but, the camera is lit and UI is also amazing. There's a little problem with the installation process of the phone which doesn't complete unless you have a really fast internet connection. The battery performance is not bad.. once charged you can use it for 2-3 days if you use it wisely only for required stuffs without playing high load games and surfing social media all day. The battery doesn't last for more that 20 hours if you always keep your internet on.. for a normal genuine phone user it's an awesome phone. It's processor is also quite fast and the looks are amazing too. It looks like a delicate phone but has metallic body on the sides and gorilla glass on the both the planes. Overall it's a nice phone. But, wouldn't recommend it for gamers and all day smartphone addicts because of battery drain.. or else it's amazing."
"It's been 6 hours I'm trying to install an app and it's just not responding. Mobile data, wifi nothing seems to work. None of the apps are getting updated, can't download new apps, what do I do with this phone? Plzz don't buy this product.."
"Those how we're going to buy this phone they should buy a type c cable because charging port is getting loose after few days, it's better to buy magnatic type c cable please go through online reviews before buying it. Camera performance is good after installing gcam app, music experience is not good from both speaker and 3.5 mm head jack disturbances will get while listening, perfectly suits for normal daily usage, not for heavy users."
Here I am enclosing the images taken by realme 1st version  (1st photo) Vs Nokia 6.1 plus image (2nd image). The photo taken by Nokia 6.1 plus is dull as compared to my older phone.
Delivered today and surprised to see a black defective screen.
I have received defective item. mobile is not charging at all and it is switched off and not starting.  Following with Amazon for last 5 days for replacement. pathetic services from Amazon.  They are caring their prime customer also
caution::: dont buy at all.... it has major major heating issue even after 10 minute of on speaker call.... it becomes uncomfortable to hold it  ... the  battery is as poor ....dat if u have habit of keeping net on ..... ur phone probably would need more than  twice full charging each day .....dat is like pathetic ....... looks r not everything .... at least it shud work like a nrml phone
"Look is awesome af. 6 GB RAM in 11,999 is great."
"Micro phone complaint, Nokia company will give replacement for this model, only repair. Which means company already know this is problematic model. Complaint shown on  32st day from the date of invoice, so Amazon not accepted return."
Incoming calls is not ringing properly and shows as a missed calls without ringing.  torch has been on without any command. I think it is not working as a normal smartphone. I think any manufacturing defects in this smartphone. Please help me. How can I remove this problems.
Waste of money camera is not good and heating problem
" Bought on 15th July and With in Week started facing Auto Restart Issue, Get it checked with Nokia care on 26th of july they had updated some software but with in 30 min I faced similar issues and for next 10 days it was with them for further analysis and they did not found such issues then they suggested to take the delivery of mobile on 10th of August  but very next day I had seen similar issue and again submitted to Nokia Care on 16 th August this time they did some another update of software but this did not worked fine as issue is still there so submitted again on 17th Aug and now waiting for them to fix a brand new device"
"Battey would be better. Performance is ok ok.. most of application like phone pe, WhatsApp and in built message app hangs and restart app serval times even mobile have 6 GB ram. Build quality , looks and touch screen is awesome.  Voice calling speaker is Ok ok.."
Phone have heating issue as well as it takes 3 hr to fully charged 2 percent to 95 percent.
Inbox headphone has worst quality. Charger is of 2000mah but in actual it's slow.
Come to the camera quality >>>  good for this price(RS 9000). Zooming is worst.front camera is good with this price range. Disappointed in low light or night photography.
Internet speed:  good
Display: very nice display and mobile can use single hand.
Overall experience >> this mobile is best for Mom Dad who have less use of camera.
If you want to buy mobile for your parents then this is best option in this range.
this review is all abput mobile only.
mobile is good but seller appario Retail Private Ltd selling you faulty product. Screen has white spot of 5 cm to 7 centimeter which ocvupied your more than half sceen. due to this half part pf mobile is more whitiesh . and very irritating. i have request for replacement and amoz is good to replaced my mobile.  the new mobile which amazon give me from same seller having same issue. there is white spot on sceen from left corner. i have again requested for replacement . since from last 15 days i have replaced mobile 2 times. i am getting refund of this my new mobile. i am getting trapped due to amazon replacement policies and that bloody seller. i also observed that amezon and that seller both are providing faulty mobile to his customer.
if you want to play game of replacement then surely buy mobile from this appario Retail Private Ltd. seller and amazon.
in the attached photo see right side of mobile having spotss.
Only one word. Disappointing. I bought this phone for my mother few days ago. This phone has a major flaw in the most basic function. During voice calls the other person is unable to hear and vice versa. The return window is also closed. Did someone face similar issue?
"It's updated 4 times afterwards show error in update, try later. Unable to start phone. No RETURN or REPLACE option. They arranged some tech visit. It's all for a new phone..."
"I made mistake by ignoring the reviews, the reviews are totally correct, the product has heating problem bcoz this mobile is not metallic body, we got fool by them, their also the software problem where it doesn't work properly. When It was working properly, i told them to return but they say we don't have any policy like this to return the product. Now what will i do with the product. Totally waste of money. It's a humble request to people, please don't buy this product and also go through the reviews"
"I was previously using Nokia 6 model for the last two years. I was pretty happy with its performance. As I don't use the phone for more than 2 hours a day, this model was perfect for my use. So when I wanted a new phone, I just went for the same but upgraded version. So far so good. The stock Android is a pleasure to use. Battery is adequate and it lasts at least two days. Both front and back cameras are decent enough for a budget phone. Speech/voice quality is pretty good. The fingerprint detector is at the back and you need to use your index finger primarily. It was a bit uncomfortable in the beginning as the old model had the detector on the front side bottom. You will need to lift the phone if it is placed somewhere (like a table) then unlock it. In the old model, you could do it without lifting the phone."
My only gripe is about the all glass back which is slippery and I have to be extra careful not to let the phone slip and drop.
Writing review after using phone for last 4 days
Pros:
1. Good built quality by Nokia
2. Android-based Phone with not a single preloaded app which will eat your Ram or battery. (Most awaited feature from Android)
3. Brighter clear crisp display
4. Good battery backup of 1 day.
"5. 16 mp front & 5 mp rear Camera Clearity is  good. Why people are discussing on it, I did not understand."
6. 6 GB Ram moves app like butter.
7. Direct contact with Nokia with their App
"8. 64 GB internal memory, no need of external card"
9. 9 Android updates readily available ( Samsung hardly Gave me anything only patches of same Android)
10.
"Night mode, Geustures are good, Finger print scanner is sensitive and display of any app shorter screen on main screen makes unique feature of this phone."
11. Password saving feature for App by Google.
Cons:
1. I Don't compare Chinese brand with outstanding Nokia they are having their limitations and pros.
So overall experience is 5 🌟 out of 5
Issue
1) I couldn't hear other side voice and I can hear them when loud speaker turned on.
2) Raised a complaint to Amazon and they arranged a technician visit within 48 hours from complaint raised time.
"3) Technician called me on scheduled time and during that time  phone was working fine and told him the same.So, without visiting in person to check the mobile he closed the ticket."
"4) Later, after 2 days I faced the same issue and it exists for 2-3 hours. I have realized that issue occuring in regular intervals. Hence, raised complaint again with Amazon and luckily that was on last day as per return policy."
"5) Amazon arranged a technician and he visited this time in person ..but unfortunately as I mentioned above, issue was not there during his visit and he said that he will close the ticket with comments stating ""No Issue"". I have surprised that how could I show him issue which is happening on and off in regular intervals..Raised the same with Amazon and they also concluded that during technician visit if the issue not persist...we will not considered it as defect piece.... A friend of mine who faced the same issue with the same model Mobile, luckily issue was persists during trchnician visit and hence,his Mobile is replaced. Here what I am trying to convey is......Finally my issue is not resolved and who is responsible to resolve my query..I believe it should be Amazon."
Note: I am thinking to file a case in CONSUMER COURT as I flet it is like cheating and harrasing a customer.
Camera is ok ok
Phone nice light and small
Purchased it for my Father. There were other options too but he wanted a phone with a screen size of less than 6 inches. This was the best option available. Looks sharp and premium. DIsplay is excellent and so is its performance. Best part is the user experience. No bloatware and no unwanted apps which could slow down the phone.
The Camera is great too.
"I think at 11999/- for a 6 GB version , it is an excellent purchase."
"Pros: This is a great phone in 11k budget with 6GB RAM and 64 GB ROM. Build quality is premium. Size of phone is ergonomically designed and very handy in use. I love it's glass back and this is reason for heating but it's quit normal. When I bought it, camera was worst but after getting update, picture quality was great and now I'm happy with it. High graphics Games such as pubg, gun of boom are working fine and smooth. No lagging in that. Sound quality is satisfactory. Display is vibrant and very rich in color. Yes it supports fast charging."
"Cons: I got this phone on 12th Aug2019. Since it was restarted twice while playing pubg. Battery is getting drained without any usage. It has only 6 hrs backup. In low light, you may not getting good quay of pictures. Sometime touch doesn't work at the edges of the phone. Fingerprint scanner response is not much faster. Small heating problem but it's very common."
"Let me begin by saying that I purchased the 6 GB variant of this phone for 12,000 on Amazon's Sale. That being said, let us come to the actual review. The phone is a dream come true for people that want a small yet powerful phone than can easily be operated with one hand. Honestly this is one of the only Android phones after Oneplus X that fits this criteria. The body is premium yet sturdy, the phone survived a face first drop on a tiled floor on the third day and that too without a cover, not a single scratch ! However, after the first week or so I started noticing micro scratches on the back glass surface, front glass remained unscathed. If you want to avoid scratches then please use a cover and tempered glass. Coming to the battery life, the phone offers full day battery and then some. Back camera is great but the front camera is only 3.8/5 IMO. I haven't used the google camera app on it yet but I'm pretty sure that it will work much better than the stock camera app raising the camera performance even further. WiFi performance is great on both 2.5 and 5 Ghz. With Jio 4G, I was able to achieve 32 Mbps D/L while Airtel gave 55 Mbps D/L speed. Speaker albeit single is plenty loud and the earpiece is awesome too. Headphone Audio and vibration is also very good. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
Since i was using Nokia 6.1 plus 4GB ram for a year and for year year of use i didnt face any lag if any problem came it was only software related. Nokia 6.1 plus has 3060mAH  battery but in heavy use it gives you almost 6 hours of on screen time and non stop PUBG gaming give u 5 hours nonstop gaming i was impressed n charging takes perfect 2 hours and charges 85%in 1hour and 20min. even oneplus 6 havin 3600mAH drains befor this phone. (for photography this is not good for low light but if you are pro by using manual settings you will get awesome photos in dark night also)  since year of use i was in love with this device. Therefore i Upgraded to 6GB ram 2019 manufactured model are much improved according to my experience. And it is androidone device so i can buy with eyes closed it gets monthly security updates and almost all firmware update in future to enjoy all new Android experience... Just an awesome device Love it.
The phone forces you to update firmware immediately after start. Since y'day downloaded 1.3 GB update 3 times and installation failed everytime. This is kind of a bummer. The phone should start with existing firmware and then give user option to update to latest firmware.
Update: Was able to download entire update without interuption and then it installed without error.
"New Android 9 experience is beautiful and functional at the same time. Phone is really fast for a working person's needs - calls, mails, some browsing. Multiple apps can work simultaneousely without lag. I have no time to play games so can't comment on that aspect."
"Phone looks sleek, professional."
"Design, call quality and screen are excellent. No lag in the few days of usage .. camera has not been used much, No forced bloatware except one Nokia support app ..  don't game but with 6gb ram it's likely going to do well... Will update if there's issues but superb phone for the price"
Update on 06-07-2019
Main dual camera is crappy .. images taken by it are dark and slightly yellowed .. whereas the same phone's in screen camera takes clear bright images ... Disappointed ..expected Nokia to deliver better.. however I don't care for the camera as much.. phone's good otherwise.  Woupd have been nice if dual cam took true to life images..
2nd sim slot not working at all... And the product is already a defective one with a tiny scratch/damage on one of the corners since i first unsealed the box and took the phone out.
A very premium design and solid build quality from Nokia.
"This phone does the day to day job seamlessly, I can't say for gaming purposes coz I don't have time for that but if you are looking for a trusted brand with premium quality this is the best phone in this price , at least for me ."
"The battery works fine from 100 to 10% from 9am to 8 pm with regular usage of phone calls and WhatsApp, even with YouTube time to time."
I m not a camera freak howsoever it's a decent camera and if you use with gcam it does the job.
In short it's a everyday use phone with a absolute premium looks and design.
I happen to use phone only for the usual needs. Not much. The things I’ve noticed are-
The screen is crisp clear and pretty sharp.
The camera app is crap. Get a better app.
Get the 6 GB version and not the 4 GB .
Phone is pretty smooth. Android one ensures you have a less cluttered phone.
The back is quite shiny and a bit smudgy.
The battery is just above average.
"i have read several reviews before buying this phone. Many of them told that the battery is weak. It hardly lasts a day. But let me tell you that i m a moderate user. The phone battery came around 2 days for me. Display is excellent. No lagging. The only problem is camera. It struggles a lot in low light. Otherwise remaining all features are good. Amazon delivery is very fast. I got the 6GB Version for Rs.9,900"
I much heared about this phone before buying it by reviews on different platforms.
"Now this marvelous phone is in my hands and I am fully satisfied with the product quality and no one other then Nokia can give this superb quality..it's killer looks buttery body smooth like silk superb finger print scanner,crisp screen,free updates , Android one no unwanted apps ,6gb ram clear speakers everything is excellent..."
But as no one is perfect so as this phone
"Talking about it's cons i would like to mention about some issues which irritates me like no default gallery no compass ,body is very silky smooth handle carefully, screenshot is a cumbersome job,bit annoying home and back button control which may be avoid in uses after some time when you got familiar with it,no body cover with it,"
"And last it's battery which is fairly decent but not for heavy uses it gives barely a day long power ,but at price of 11K it really an amazing deal full Paisa wasool ..."
I like this phone go for it...
"And at last I want to say something for the people who gave dead negative comments please use it once you bought a 11k phone don't compare it with OnePlus 7 or Samsung 10,it's far ahead in the category of 10k other Chinese phones..."
"It never felt like a 6gb ram phone, hanging issue in just 2 weeks."
"worst service by amazon, camera is bad in low light. requested amazon on the very first day to return the phone"
 but they denied.
phone is a waste..
"It’s the first Nokia phone with a notched display, marking a departure from the design cues seen in its predecessors. There’s also a capable mid-range chipset, Android One certification, dual cameras and a compact form factor, that makes it all the more interesting. The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes off as a potential alternative to the best-selling Redmi Note 5 Pro. With similar hardware powering the two, the choice comes down to the software and user interface one is comfortable using. The Nokia 6.1 Plus is also more compact, making it easy to hold and use. It’s camera, however, is a tad underwhelming and cannot hold a candle to the likes of the Redmi Note 5 Pro or the Xiaomi Mi A2."
PROS:
Premium design
Compact form-factor
Stock Android UI
CONS:
Underwhelming camera
Poor battery life
"Nice phone for daily usages, look like a premium device. Best in this segment. Camera was good."
"I don't know why some people have given this phone bad reviews - it is an excellent product for its price and size. The build quality is superb and feels premium, the cameras are very good and even though the battery is 3,060mAh, it lasts a good 3-4 days with moderate use. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the OS had already been updated to Android Pie 9 :)"
My 3 main reasons for purchasing this phone was:-
1: SIZE: I did not want an overly large phone that feels bulky in the pocket and needs two hand to use.
2: OS: With Android One installed there is no unnecessary Bloatware that other manufactures add.
"3: PRICE: At this price I got a phone from a well respected brand, loaded with awesome features. (Gorilla Glass 3, 6GB ram/64GB Storage, quick Fingerprint Sensor, etc, etc..)"
My only criticism is that the earphone supplied could have been better quality.
Awesome
"Everything is great about this device. I also like the fact that it's slightly smaller than other devices, which makes it great for one handed use."
"I personally don't use the camera much, so I cannot comment on that; but other than that, everything else - software, battery life, performance, display etc - is amazing. I haven't found a single flaw in this device yet"
"If you are fine with the camera, notch and the smaller size, I would say that this is the best budget android one device out there"
"Waste phone. I brought yesterday phone  , when I opened in the morning . Phone is not switching on. And charger sloot is loose. Phone is completely overeheating"
Love this product
If you are not a fan of large screens and prefer to use with single hand then definitely this will not disappoint.
"Small form factor, powerful mobile, very sturdy phone from Nokia."
"Default camera needs improvement, if you are buying for clicking pictures then you may have to use some other app and if that is primary reason to buy the phone then please rethink as this may disappoint you."
Finally Nokia is back.!
"The goods are,"
1. Very smooth interface
2. No hidden application in devices
3. Most of the apps are from Google store.
The negetives are
1. Camera (Nokia should focus on that)
2. Battery ( It's depends on uses but for me it is 1.5 days and the charging time is 2 hours approx)
Overall at this price 6GB Ram and 64 GB internal memory which is expendable also. I don't think it is a bad choise.
Thank you!
"This product is just amazing. At this price, its too good. Unbelivable. Camera might not be the best, but you have product which is great looking, beautiful form factor, good memory, great response and the most important thing is that it comes at this price."
Please go ahead and chose Nokia. Not the other Chinese phones.
"Ordered this phone after some research and looking at the ratings and reviews, I thought this shall be a nice gift for my Mom's birthday. However, it turned out a disaster. Right from day#1 it just kept throwing issues. Unexplained call drops, inconsistent volume, Average camera quality (felt it was hyped) and after a week it went into some weird ""download mode"" and it never switched on again. I had to spend 3-4 days finding out the process to return and then I realized it was only a replacement. The technician did not come on the scheduled day for inspection . Overall , terrible experience with the seller , product and amazon in this particular case. I had no other choice, but to accept replacement even though my mom does not want to use this phone again"
A smooth stock android experience. That's what this phone's main advantage is. Battery lasts all day in moderate usage. Not a good choice if you are planning to game on it. Screen is good. Speaker is loud for most occasions. Cameras are average. Slow focusing speed is one thing that bugs me. Charging is not fast charging with the included charger. But even then it doesn't take that long for a full charge.
"Best part about this phone is stock Android and timely updates. Kudos to Nokia for that. A smooth, day to day phone in my opinion."
P.S. The phone feels really good in my hand and has good build quality.
"Performance of the product is not adequate,"
"Battery back up is very poor, and finger print readers are also not working properly."
its software android in not updating even on wifi
"I have been using it for over 20 days now,"
Pros
1. Pictures in day light are amazing
"2. Fast, there is no lag whatsoever on running asphalt xtreme, I have continuously play for 40 minutes. The phone did heat up a bit but it's common now a days."
"3. Comparing the price to product, it is an amazing buy."
"4. Many claimed that the charging port does not work properly over long run. Its only 20 days, haven't faced that issue yet."
"5. Battery life is huge, I have charged it 100%, with minimum usage it lasted more than two days. Heavy usage it lasted nearly a day."
Cons.
1. The touch sometimes does not read properly. It becomes annoying sometimes.
2. Low light camera is a big con. Images loose their sharpness and video quality in low light flickers.
"I wish it had on-screen finger-scanner, because lot of mobile companies are offering this feature in this price range. LED notification a useful feature missing."
"Super awesome very nice and very smooth phone I never used this type of phone till now sooo many mobiles are there but I go for it because of the build quality is good nice to use it... Battery pack up is good one full day will come no issue camera is not that much good but it's ok no issues only one reason to purchase to this phone 6Gb, 64Gb no one phone will come at this price so I saw so I purchased this totally full satisfied with the product."
"I got the phone yesterday, only to discover today that the phone doesn't fully support Bluetooth devices."
It connected with my car navigation system BUT it doesn't support the calling function!
"The navigation system throws up an error ""Your phone doesn't support calling feature""."
All other phones just seamlessly connect with the car's system - so the problem is clearly with Nokia 6.1 Plus.
A bit of Google tells that the Nokia has poorly implemented the Bluetooth functions and missed out on a few.
Poor show.
"Battery issue, charging is very slow, camera dullness"
Sorry to say mobile phone has stop working with in 24 hrs . However being a loyal customer of Nokia i am going to purchase Nokia .
Received the phone screen locked out of the box How is it possible i do not understand maybe its a replacement peace
If this is the matter its called fraud
I had paid 250 to local mobile shope to rest the phone as the phone waa not even  getting hard reset by the button push procedure
And now after entering the sim card its network signal keeps on blinking
Very bad experience
Dislike the phone. It's not working
Quick impression:
"Premium build, compact and light weight, Android one, Corning Gorilla glass, Fast charging capability, Type-C port"
"Fingerprint sensor not quick, Adaptive backlight struggles, some weird bugs."
"Best Smart Phone, if you budget is under 10k and you have buy back option."
#Fingerprint reader is quiet good...
#Camera quality is also Good with best quality depth control; 16+5 MP is more than enough dont depend on other reviewers its a NOKIA.
"#Battery Life is also good, it depends on use."
Other functions are good as its an android one + Pie version phone.
"Images of the photos taken from the Nokia 6.1 Plus phone  were in NEGATIVE, very dull and display quality very poor.  Hence I have requested for replacement of the phone in lieu of this defective piece.  Though the delivery was expected on 23rd, it did not come and the Agent did not even care to call back or liaise with me to coordinate the delivery of the packet.  I have again requested for replacement  on phone to Amazon."

Recommended to buy if the following are your requirements (as were mine)
"- price < 15,000 INR (bought it for 10,999)"
- good build quality (always a strong point with Nokia)
- stock Android without any bloatware
"- comfortably able to operate with one hand due to its relatively smallish dimensions, but still good enough for browsing, reading"
"- good battery life (even though 3060 mAh doesn't sound much, it easily lasts a whole day with about 40% remaining with moderate use i.e. browsing, reading ~ 1.5 hours, phone calls ~ 30 mins, other miscellaneous use ~ 1 hour - no gaming)"
- decent sepcifications (infact has a generous 6GB ram and a decent processor - Snapdragon 636; I have found this combination to be more than enough for moderate usage)
"- want a simple, no-nonsense phone and are not too fussy about camera and cosmetic features (it is handsome looking nevertheless, but a back cover is recommended due to the glass back; I am not a camera fanatic or an expert, but with my very limited understanding of the domain, I found the pics to be quite pleasant and realistic i.e. the colour reproduction was quite good in daylight; I have no interest and have not bothered to check the low light performance)"
" Very poor quality phone, it hangs and crashes every few minutes. Also, my sincere advise to never buy electronics from Amazon as they don’t take ownership of such issues."
"I paid amount for phone, temper glass and back cover but I just received only phone I didn't get other things. Send my required things for what I have paid amount as soon as possible"
Built quality it amazing you won't get this much slim and beautiful phone in this range. If you're one who have used big screen phones then you may find this phone comparatively small.
Screen is of really very good quality. And of hi ppi and the fingerprint working fine.
What I disliked about it is battery backup is less because it is just 3060 Mah.
Camera is outstanding and works amazing in Day light but it's not good for night or low light shooting.
Some of you may wanting to know about network issue or signal problem. Even I have heard about network issue in nokia 6.1 plus so when I was placing order I was fearful about its network issue.  But the unit i have received by amzon is not having any weak or no signal issues..even the net is working fast.
"I m writing my review for this device after purchase of 10 days, overall I m happy."
"Nokia bang on with its quality product, only few set back but not big one;"
Camera result is good not gr8.
"Battery is little concerned, one type full charge perform for a day &  dual sim slot given but not seperate for Micro SD Card which they should provided. You can either use dual sim or one sim with SD Card at a time."
🙂
"As I got it at discounted price hence good deal, finger print is also good, immediately we can't say much as once the memory gets near to ful then few phones hang, so for now it's ok, regarding camera still there is a scope of improvement , my daughter is not satisfied , compare to other mobiles in this range"
Positive - 1) Good looks. 2) Camera is cool. 3) Excellent looks
Area of Improvement - 1) Nokia to provide good quality war phones. 2) Additional tempered glass front & Back along with glass cleaner. 3) Multiple Text message could not be deleted at once you have to delete them one by one or you might be able to delete entire conversations from sender
"At 10k price point nothing comes close to this , true price to performance! 6gb ram makes everything so snappy and love stock android! super fast updates etc and build quality is fantastic overall phone looks like a mini one plus! but main downside is camera! don't get me wrong it takes good photos in daylight but colours are bit off and basically performance becomes unusable in night time but overall great phone"
"Don't know whether a real one or fake. There is no details like where it has been manufactured, year manufacturing and unit address, mrp details have been printed. But it has nokia 6.1 plus outer box. No imei stickers on that box either printed. Only the model number and image printed on outer cover. Feels like original. Anyhow little not of doubt that not to get be cheated. After i was answered by somebody will improve start rating."
There is no use to give option like adaptive brightness lot of options are not in settings
Nokia has it's reputation. It has been preserved in this phone. Battery lasts long even if it is 3000mAh. design is awesome. snapdragon 636 with 6 gb ram gives fabulous performance.
screen seems bit small but quality of pictures is great. device is very handy. happy to be with Nokia again after 10 years
Not recommended to buy if you need good battery performance. Mobile is heating up quickly even if you talk for 5 to 10 minutes.
Also while placing a replace request amazon is not accepting and I am very much unsatisfied with amazon regarding this.
Everything about this Nokia 6.1 plus phone is awesome. Got this one in 10k but 11k was price after amozon discount also 1k discount in EMI option.
"Design : Much more than expected, seems like premium one."
Camera : front one good but rear one little bit not good but it was ok. Can be better if Google cam installed.
"Configuration : 6 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM what else required with this less price."
Much more features are available in this phone. Just do RND.
"So, personally I'll recommend this phone to everyone those who have budget in between 10k to 12k"
"Awesome phone at this price range, I don't like brand, like OPPO , vivo, xiome, real me, poco, OnePlus, this all Chinese brands having maximum level of radiation, people doesnt no about that, they have teach there children's, it wil spoil your kids health... Pls be aware of Chinese brands, go for Samsung,Nokia ,Sony, iPhone, this are trusted brands it will give long lasting and durability,"
"I like the design, smoothness, handy,"
"Dislike battery performance, not last for one day use.Again required have to charge. I bought this product on ICICI Bank credit card 3 EMI on discount price but extra interest on amortization is charged  Rs 126 while paying EMI. Finally the cost of mobile phone is equivalent to actual rate as shown.. No benefit at all purcharging from Amazon"
I have ordered Nokia 6.1 plus from Amazon I am very old  online customer 4-5 phones already purchased Flipkart and Amazon but this phone received was not sealed by Nokia sticker only a simple tape but after 8 days (just 2 days left in returns) phone stopped incoming calls in SIM 1 but I wasn't aware until next day because net was working properly on 9th day when I called from SIM 1 the calls started disconnecting after 31 seconds n SIM 1 on SIM 2 it's working also incoming only on SIM 2 not on SIM 1 now let's see what Amazon will do
 It will decide that our group people will use online shopping for phone or not. Because in offline they return phone within 14 days on the spot.
U can't get a better phone than this 1 with in 11K. Just buy a good usb type c data cable after market as the provided cable may lead to charging problem. It's an affordable premium and handy device.
Over all Mobile is good with regards operations and processing only there is one lacking camera.
I think Nokia should improve it.
Lookwise and weightwise is so good.
If anyone want to use it for official purpose then its good.
For those call recorder feature is important they will miss this feature. For some reasons Nokia has not included this feature in the phone. Nokia should learn from its competitors in Indian market to grow further.
Size is ok. U can use it by single hand .
Awesome design .
Build quality is good
Camera quality is awedome.
A day battery life of normal usage and whole day data uses except games.
I got this at 11k and in this price nokia 6.1+ is good option to buy .
But its little bit slow compare to this segment. But its acceptable .
One of the worst handset ever i seen. Don't purchase. Phone heat issue is there. Escalated to amazon peoples but their response is not satisfied. Camera clarity poor. Totally  headset performance is worst.
"Product with scratches, marks and cut on metal body having error in software downloading and installing."
"Very poor quality of camera,sound,touchscreen"
"All specifications are good but three are disappointed me . First is its camera flash , which makes photos yellowish. Second is its battery which drains very fastly as compared to other phones at this price range. Third is its camera is not very good in low light photography. Overall it is very good smartphone. It's display is very good it has curved display"
"Got 6gb RAM Nokia mobile at 10800 after previous mobile lost, nice to get same model in reduced price"
"Bought the phone with high expectation, but sorry to say with 6GB ram installed, phone works like 1 GB Ram."
Already Booked replacement as defective piece received. Heating is too much. Quite Slippery.
Very Bad. Mobile sound problem and camera effect not good
Very pathetic Battery life. With moderate use also it doesn't last till eight pm in the evening from morning eight. While making calls the person on other side is unable to hear my voice clearly. I will not recommend this product.
Nice Product Eminent look i got this phone from amazon just 10999 INR very worthy at this price range. Premium look decent battery life nice finger print sensor and keeping good body quality one negative thing i felt is its hybrid phone. Nokia maintain its standards at all aspects very happy. Highly recommended in this price range with these features
Pros
1. Good battery life
2. No lagging
3. Good camera
4. Android one
5. Good Sim range
6. Very good looks
7. Handy phone. Not too big
Cons
Non
"Before this i was using a pixel and i can say performance of this phone is on par or even better than pixel except camera. Build is superb , clean android experience , works like a butter with 100s of apps . In long run battery life may be a concern but what more u expect in 11k product."
Camera quality is worst
"Great looking phone, with premium glass finish on the back. Comes with Android 9 pie and Android One UI both of which are rare for phones in this price range and have all the latest features and capabilities. Camera seems decent but haven't tested in different conditions. Audio and video quality up to mark. Charging could be faster."
Not up to the mark. Phone is getting very heat whike using. This is not expected from Nokia. I have tried to contact the Customer Care for return but their trying to convince me to retain the handset. Paying 11k is totally waste. Now im in trap don't know whether they will return it or not.
6gb bol kar 4bg de gye . It is not good
Pros
1. looks good
2. Screen is good
3. Android one
4. 6gb Ram
Cons
1. Bad camera quality.
2. Phone not responds often. Needs restart. Lot of sw issues.
3. When using nokia charging cable the phone heats up. This does not happen with Sony/Samsung type c cable (with Nokia charger). Not sure if this causes charging port problem.
Overall ok for 10k (offer price).
"I had purchased this phone a month back, so far I haven't encountered any performance issues. Camera sensors are good but Nokia's camera app is disappointing. When I used a moded Google cam app, the quality of images taken improved about 10 times. I felt customizing the os settings less convenient on Nokia 6.1+ than on Nokia 6(2017), though both are running Android pie with minimal changes."
"Overall, it is value for money, if you want to use it as a power user then you might need to tweak few things here and there."
There is no phone in this segment with this configuration. It is a beauty of stock android that the battery doesn't drain easily when your are not using a phone. Camera quality is OK.
The phone is glass hence a little bit slippery. Using back cover.
"I'm using for more than a month now. Very good fast response and amazing specs. I'm running pubg comfortably, no lag, good sensitivity. Good volume. Camera is only average."
Nice phone in this price Rs 11000. It depends completely on the seller what he or she is selling. As damaged article or cell is not sold by Amazon it's basically the seller . My cell is perfectly fine . Talking about camera ROM Ram.. Just a little bit heating problem. Else everything is fine
"Only thing I ll point is it's battery that is to small for a 6/64 mobile that is 3k something other wise it's a best phone you can ever have stunning graphics, high speed processer 6gb ram."
Also not to forget only a second sim or a memory card can be putted at a time. But 64gb memory help me out that no additional memory is required.
"qwic lock not working, some times hanging, no voice recorder, no call recorder, looking good but featucher worest& amazone sirvice is not good iam tlaking 2 times refund money issu but he custmor support team answar not happy."
Performance was good
Compact Design
Stock Andriod
If you looking for a phone under 12k !!!! Go for it
Nice phone
Nothing to dislike
Some customers are complaining about body heating
  I personally think that every phone has heating issue
Nothing to worry about it
Don't charge your phone above 2 hours
It will increase phones battery life
Excellent mobile...nice grip
Slim design quality & looking wise very good
Best Performance
6GB 64GB NO problem...
Thanks Amazon and Nokia...
Some draw back is
Face unlock
And
Hybrid system
Single sim or memory card or dual sim without memory card
Battery backup..100/100
I believe that Nokia always serve quality products. I was very happy with Nokia 5.1 plus. This Nokia 6.1 plus operating system needs drastic changes. The initial update took almost whole night. Google and whether widgets on the home screen cant be removed. To browse apps we have to swipe up home button that shows task killer first this is annoying. These are the first few things i noticed in two days use. Coming to the look thats premium and handy.
Nokia lover .... Best phone ..... Camera average.... Battery life.... Beloww average ..... Display.... Perfect.....look and feel good....in..11000Rs  this phone best...stock android experience is best ... Nokia give regular updates.... But ...after pie update ..my google assistant voice unlock  does not workk.....🤒 Battery life is poor... That is killing mee🤒🤒🤒 other specifications are good...charging time 2 hrs... Some times 2 .15hrs...still love this phone..🥳😚😚
The mobile which delivered by Amazon has some defects.
Defects:-
1. Battery backup is not good.
2. Often touch is not recognized.
3. Finger print performance is not good.
During phone calling & charging it's battery become very hot.Heating of phone battery takes place.
"Unlike other Android devices, Nokia seems to be a bit advanced as it takes care of the memory usage and acts/suggests accordingly."
"Best buy for a office user. Battery is awesome. Even less than so called higher configuration chinese mobiles, it lasts for more than 1 day even with 70% charging. no ads, malware, blogwar. so Android ONE is no.1. Only lacuna is camera, which is not so upto the mark. Day pictures are great but low light and zoom is disappointing. 6 GB RAM is great. Nokia feel in hand is great."
"A amazing product by nokia,, still need more updates to improve the camera quality,, literally the camera is good but suffer from low light condition.. front camera is nice... And the battery is too much low,, so a heavy user face battery problem with it.. There is no lack or heating issue for day yo day use.. good picture clarity.. and sound quality is beautiful. I am satisfied with it."
"I was using nokia 6, it was  single 16mp camera phone with 3 gb ram, and internal storage is 32 gb only . I bought it in ₹ 13000/- only since October 2017. now Come on to nokia 6.1 plus it has 16mp + 5mp back camera with AI bokeh mode and they have 6gb ram with 64gb internal storage in ₹ 10,999/- only so whats wrong to deal with Nokia..."
SO THIS IS FULL PAISA VASOOL PHONE RAB IT
I received product after replacement.
"When I opened packet, noticed that mobile was used by someone before I received and packing was not good during second time (replacement) received."
When I switched on mobile observed that mobile was only set to viberate mode instead of ringtone.
I really disappointed with Amazon.
I am planning to return this mobile to amazon.
"The very premium thing that I like in this phone is the Camera, the photos are taken really ultimate."
"You ppl believe it or not the rear cameras has inbuilt video stabilization i.e, the video we capture won't be noisy."
"It has a great premium display, premium design material quality and also front camera doseba great job..."
"Guys if you are planning to buy a mid range phone just go for NOKIA 6.1 plus (6gb ram, 64 GB ROM)...."
Best value of money
Enjoying phone with no problem nd it's so light weight nd handy
Battery works excellen
Battery long lasting excellent wrk.
Fully satisfied to buy sach brand named Nokia
The phone that I received has some software issues. I'm unable to install the software. I filed a complaint immediately after I received the product. It's been one week and my phone has not been replaced yet. I'm highly disappointed with Amazon's customer services.
Worst camera and mobile is getting heated very quickly for a small operation..
" Just purchased Nokia 6.1 plus yesterday started using it, basic message application not working, tried to reset factory reset nothing still not working. I'm stuck with a dud instrument."
I don know why people disliking the phone.
I got this phone in 6 GB ram 10999.
Camera too pretty
Just go and buy it without any discussion when u will take this phone in hand you will worth the money as well.
Although battery is not enough but the ram optimisation is good due the battery back up is Increased.
Screen full hd plus display played well just bit difference between anoles and this panel...
After a long using Nokia. Post feature phones this phone is compact and specially the android one version made this phone much faster than other phones. Very handy. Clear sound and camera
Camera quality .. low light performance is worst.
Android One vs Samsung or MI UI :
Always go for mobile with UI
.plain Android is not that user-friendly as we think.. UI will allow us to customise much more ..
Oreo had back buttun style selection.
Now it's removed. Really a joke..
Camera slow-motion also works in off way
Batter drains heavily very fast... Not even overall battery duration stands for 16hrs.. very worst product service from Amazon... Not even responding and no response..
Product is totally useless which is not working properly and a lots are problem are there since beginning and as per my opinion one should not buy any product online.
I am writing this review after using 2 weeks.
Worth to try for the specification.
"Battery stays for two days with intermittent use of net, videos, camera."
"Only fault i found in video recording. With by default Camera recording, flash lines are recorded while shooting. This problem can be overcome by using different camera app from play store."
Almost 1.5 GB is used by the defaults app and system.
First impression of phone is good. It's only 2-3 days of use this phone so i will post my opinion after using 2-3 months. For charging port problem I am facing not issue at least now so i will decided to post reviews after using some month. Thanks
"Camera front and back very nice.  Phone weightage look's like iphone(easily handling). Very low cost 6gb, 64gb mobiles to compared with other brands.  Phone slightly feel heating problem, due to the glass body.  Otherwise very good."
"The value for money is a  tricky here. It's a gamble. Though I know the camera is average. I bought this phone 15 days before for 12 k, now it's 11k. Feels like unlucky orrr cheated..... Since I hate the bigger phones, this phone is bit better for my choice with the trust on the brand name. Eventhough it's stock android, the adframe from the games still running on the phone, makes annoying."
"Excellent product  , same Nokia where we can trust on build quality , best quality accessories , beat quality data cable"
"6gb ram and 65 rom best quality at cheaper price , a lot of Nokia unique features ...Just excellent"
Have been blinded by IOS for while and thought to keep a stock Android for a while.
"After 10 mins of research, decided to go with NOKIA."
"After I got this phone, am amazed with the level of effort NOKIA had put to assemble such a powerful yet magnificent piece together."
Camera could have been better.
Encore!
Nokia 6.1 plus device have a major problem
1. Heating mobile too much
It is cross the level 46 degree in safe mode and Normal mood 49 degree and above..
"Nice looking and good quality materials... But ihave a biggest problem, The voice does not clear when calling..... Nothing clears the person beyond.... I changed the SIM, but not ready.... I don't really know what the probability of this is.Any help?"
West of time iam purshed here..Mobile nokia 6.1...not working proper
Excellent phone at Rs 12000/-. No issues faced except for system update which is not getting updated even over WiFi. Battery backup is poor. It's Made in India.
hi
"am buying the product based on reviews.it,s good product but some features are not up to the mark.eg.camera not standard and very smooth and configuration also not up to reach the mark overall 3 stars I gave this Nokia 6.1 plus"
"Very smooth functioning... Good memory, RAM... A lot of useless apps on Android phones have been removed from the phone which saved a lot memory... Just it has common slot for memory card and sim card so one can either use 2 sim cards or one sim card and memory card... Otherwise phone performance is best in budget phones"
"Mobile Start up after insert sim, is very slow even fast network available. Better start without sim & than switch off phone and insert sim."
I bought this mobile before one month and after one month usage I am satisfied with it. I play pubg 1-2 hours per day but never gets hanged or over heated. Battery backup is little short but charging is fast so it can be manageable.
Well Firstly Everything Is Good In This Phone I Just Wanted Super Omled Display Instead Like Samsung And About That Camera Yes U can improve Camera By Downloading Gcam From XDA Developers Sight FOR nokia 6.1Plus I Got The Best Results And I Also Wanted More Battrey Backup like 3500 Mah Instead Of 3000 Is Good Nokia Please Add These To Your Phone Other Wise I Love The Phone
Its a complete fail product.
Device is getting heated up and sound quality is very poor.
Battery is getting drained quickly.
You will get many products of better quality in this price.
Apart from this Amazon's no return policy is a huge drawback of buying phone online.
the product doesn't need much words as it is value for money.
i got it on additional discounts while the prime sale was on. overall happy to have a butter smooth operating unit at pretty decent price.
I have purchased this mobile on 2 of aug and after that today cellphone suddenly stops working... It could not switch on so i go to the service center they say that ur phone is not under warranty and all i said its a new phone and its not working now they didn't hear anything say they don't help me with this... Poor nokia poor brand and poor service..
Totally premium touch and feel at this price (Got for 10990/-). And Nokia no-nonsense functionality.
Camera and all features above expectations. Totally go for it at this kind of price.
"Nice phone, handy and battery is good"
This phone is a good buy under 15k which gives you 6GB RAM 64 GB disk space.
"Performance wise, its good. Never hanged until now."
Camera quality 16MP + 5MP is not so great. It lacks clarity. Mi phones have better cameras.
"Fingerprint touch is smooth, No problems in that."
"Disappointed in the way the touch feels, it is not as smooth as Mi phones."
"I bought this nokia 6.1 plus(6GB) for ₹10999, it ha s type c charger and earphone jack but still type c earphone supports at charging cable even though not mentioned by nokia. so i dont recommend type c earphones for the mobile."
I have wanted to buy a Nokia smartphone as Nokia keypad phone was best.
The phone looks amazing than other smartphones that I have bought. I will use it to the max. Just one day use and am happy with its performance. Cheers!
super smooth performance
"Dear Nokia,"
"I have been a fan of Nokia ever since 2002. I got this model yesterday. Super...No words..It's probably a bit higher than I taught. Camera is super.Dear Nokia,if you want to get back on the market you have to give it a Good Battery Capacity. Because today's Generation is using mobile every 15 minitues. Please note.."
Extremely poor camera quality makes the phone's other features meaningless. It's photos are very dark indoors even in a well lit setting.
"Battery life, No pre loaded apps & even no basic apps like calender, clock, compass, folder explorer etc. Over heat, can't tolerate holding mobile for few seconds while using hotspot are drawback in this."
"As expected,  the build quality is superb ! worth the price ... got it for 10799 on hdfc debit card deal ... working like a charm !"
Good and reliable product from Nokia. The placement of fingerprint sensor is not proper. Amazon delivery and support is great.
If you love Nokia..Just go for it..
"The camera,the interface all perfect"
Nokia lovers won't regret for this phone
The phone got everything the style the beauty the grace ...
Only low light video recording is an issue for Photo junkies..(I knew that before buying but the brand NAME NOKIA itself is sufficient)
main advantage is you can use 2 Jio sims at a time with 4G connectivity and performance is outstanding touch and fringerprint is so good as I know this phone is very affordable to buy in our budjet.
Gifted to brother he loves it. Great performance with rich look. Overall experience is great.
"Looking at the pics of the product I couldnt guess the size, thinness n etc. When it arrived, I saw the body n it amazed me as I didnt expected such thin size n less weight. Rich look phone. About features- Phone battery is nice, Camera is decent not amazed me at that level. Happy with my purchase."
"As other users might have already mentioned, the camera is excellent in sunlight but it struggles during lower light. Also, the battery backup is comparatively low, else, it's a best product in segment...it has more than one could expect at this price."
Can the black Nokia 6.1 plus 6 GB ram variant be replaced with the blue colour with same features since the MRP for blue is 20000+ and the for the black one is 18400+. I think I was cheated on this regard. If not possible for exchange can I get refund of the difference since both the phones are now available for 10999.00.
"The biggest problem with this set is not to get the network in second sim slot.I had a contact with Nokia technical team regarding the same,but they also failed to rectify this problem."
Good handset but battery back-up is inadequate also heating problem is there.
Otherwise it's a good mobile phone.
BEST MOBILE.  Purchased on 21 August 2019.
Superb. Very smooth. Perfect. Even for pubg. No overheating. No complaints at all. Much better than Samsung or redmi
I'm having issues with updating  system interface.
"I have done almost 10 time to update my phone, but it won't update."
Overall phone is slayer.
Camera is okay.
Battery life too sufficient for one day.
User interface is great.
Loved the handy look at this much affordable price.
"Overall phone is good ,but I am totally disappointed with camera , phone is fast no lagging issue, battery is pretty good their is a good voice clearaty in voice call & speaker sound also , fingerprint is not so faster as compared with Xiaomi , overall good if you have low uses of camera...."
There is an issue in display near notch....
A slight misplacement near Front camera lens....
Hope it doesnot affect in future...
Phone performing well...
GOOD AS I ACCEPTED
BUT
I M NOT HAPPY WITH BATTERY
BUT MOBILE IS MY GOD I DON'T HAVE A WORDS TO EXPLAIN
I LOVE NOKIA SO MUCH FROM YEAR 2000 FROM LAST 19 YEARS
NO ONE CAN BE LIKE NOKIA WHAT COUSTMER WANT
"nokia box packaging was questionable.In just setting up the the phone, battery down to 38%.front camera Rating 2/5 ,setting up pubg took 25 mins to download on a 25 mbps internet plan. PUBG playing experience was good 4/5 as comp to iphone..so overall3.5/5  ..Rest see after few days .Its my first day.."
What I like about this phone is his look and mirror body . It is just a copy of apple i7 in physical appearance . Overall in such a price range with 6gb ram u win in a deal .
It's premium quality and the feel u get it in it hand is just awesome . If u want to have a good phone in such an economy just go fo it.
From the first day itself the mobile touch is not working. I need to force restart to use the touch for few minutes and again the touch will not work again same thing I need to repeat force restart.
Nokia 6.1 plus is good phone.
Good features:
"Display is good, camera is good, finger print reader works fast, notification style is good."
Lack in phone:
Although every phone has its own disadvantages like that Nokia 6.1 plus has battery issue. Full battery charging run only a 10 to 12 hours.
The phone is awsome. I loved it♥️.
Camera is good (for me). And it has a good premium look and also very nice performance.
"But they could have increased the battery capacity a Little more, atleast for the 6gb varient."
Overall its the best pbone with premium looks and quality at this price.
"From the first hour the fon started heating, camera is below average, after 2 days sensors stopped working, battery was fine, pubg runs smoothly, internet works very fast... I am going for the replacement hoping the issue may get fixed."
"Why i am unable to update the phone,, i am trying"
"Since the phone came ,, after several attempts it still shows the error,,"
Looks wise it's a good phone with light weight but Battery life is worst! Mobile internet doesn't work in this phone! Sound quality is decent. I was happy thinking Nokia is back but there's a long way to go!
"Good, but Please fix regular issues....."
"Except RAM and ROM there is nothing is Nokia 6.1 Plus (6GB RAM and 64GB ROM), camara is average."
NIce Phone in that budget .... Battery Life & Camera  can be slightly better ...  But Fits into the pocket .... Performance wise really good.. Nokia is Nokia
As expected....
Use with Google camera. Its give excellent result.
"Charging pin does not fit perfectly but it works fine, just a week after use will update later, forgot to say not the fastest charger compred to other type C"
We bought it on 14 august 2019 since then batary is not working we have to charge it every half an hour.even return option is also not shown here. so Pls call us .
Overall Nokia 6.1 plus is worth for money from trusted brand.... But I received with some scratches in back side... Border of the notch I saw some shadow... Bought two mobiles (black & blue) black was ultimate & good condition but blue found some issues which I mentioned above...
Got it on offer so the price is reasonable. Considering the low battery life......would not have purchased it at the MRP. Am enjoying the user friendliness and the speed of the phone.
"Dislike the product very much,very bad features and camera quality,i wasted my money,do not purchase this mobile from amazon.😕If you did not like the mobile after delivery ,you would not return it back ,amazon provides replacement option only in some cases.Worst experience on amazon."
"Excellent phone I love it 😘 superb battery performance and display quality,  Camera Quality, Amezing. Amazon delivered the phone committed  date and the delivery  man very nice person  * Excellent Superb Service*"
Thanks Amazon Team 😊
seems like refurbished or faulty phone delivered
build quality difference in phone body
Worth every ₹ of it.
Using it for last 3weeks. Very happy with the phone.
Batter life could have been improved.
Rest all is great.
"U can go for it for 11,000₹ else add 6k more and buy Mi 7 note."
Value for money.
Kind of business phone.
Don't expect all the premium features.
 Battery life very poor  only 2-3 hours only
Heating problem also on operating and charging time.
So i'm not satisfied with this mob nokia 6.1 plus .
Plz help me
"Nokia 6.1 plus is actually great mobile,this is my second 6.1 plus mobile and I m bloody satisfied with its overall features and performance."
Great deal in at just 10999/- never get this deal again PLZZ try and buy.
"The only reason for 4 star is the battery, but otherwise awesome product. The battery is 3000 mah which is ok, but again it has got fast charging which covers the lesser power battery to some extent."
Amazing product from affordable price. I have try to buy this same mobile through retail shops price difference between 3k to 5k. Never expected this much features under 11k. Very slim and very lite... Special thanks  for Amazon and product provider. on time delivery...🙏
The updates didn't get install. So no further surfing could be done to know whether it's other feature works or not.
As price is best mobile .
Mobile body is very slim and light weighted.
Very cool mirror like back cover.
But some time camera button not properly click some time.
But Google camera you should download for this issue.
Little boring interface and as it is new model and less people are trying this.. many apps are not designed as per its screen view hence creating problem sometimes but rest is good.
Since system updation failure time and again which is big issue for this mobile.
"Best mobile in the normal range... Front camera is fantastic, for gaming i think its normal experience and i can't say best.. As the screen is little bit smaller according to my acceptance"
No way to know about ram of mobile though Nokia boasts of 6 GB ram . Camera is below average.
Bed project received 20 din bad phone on nahi hota hi and back panel damage
"The quality of phone is very poor, battery doesn't last even for 1day in standby mode"
Good one
I have been using the phone for some days and i can say it is running very smoothly with a heavy usage. camera quality is awesome. Good display and battery life.
I got this mobile one week back bur performence is good but charging pin is not working properly it s port issue or charger issue idont know i want to replace item
Over all good mobile in 10k range. Battery life cover full day plus. Camera is good but not As good as Nokia is known for. Still brand is brand. But if ur budget is more then dnt but this. it will be a compromise... specially for the camera....
Awesome smartphone in this budget
Milnd blowing performance and features.
Love this phone. Full pack phone.
There is so much problems in software & hardware in this phone so please change this product.
"It’s screen automatically switched off or on, automatically screen shots, so much others problem"
"Please take it reverse and give other same product, I hope so"
Simple and nice user-friendly as it used to be. Only that cp client provisional frequent message irritating a bit.
"Upgrade my phone from Nokia 6 to Nokia 6.1 thinking it's metal body, but it's plastic body. Charging is not fast. Camera is not so great. Watch out with Amazon. They are saying it's Replacement and not Refund. Total waste buy."
Everything best except camera. Camera will disappoint you
Nokia 6.1 plus is a good phone. The design and the specifications of the phone is awesome. 6GB Ram enabled phone is making it very fast and smooth. Camera is not 100% as desired. Battery is making a weak feature of the phone.
Xcellent mobile lite weight & elegant to use
"Defect product received, problem solved by Nokia technician in service centre. Thanks Nokia. Amazon needs to change T&C of return policy."
"I had a lots of confusion with the original and unused item, my friends have confused me a lot with making a purchase from Amazon. But I am satisfied with my decision.Amazon send me Original and brand new Nokia 6.1 plus. Excellent"
Great phone for gaming...Can operate single handed rather than big screen phones which can't.
Its good to have a Nokia..
I like this phone because no one is offering the configuration under the size and weight except apple. battery is quite low power and but significant for daily routine use.
"OK,Sometimes shows hanging problem,call recording and multiple contact number saved in the same name is not available if we are selecting the number from call list.Screen and heating problems are much better compared to terminate 4o,verall it is ok"
It is very Nice. But unable to find RAM capacity whether 6 GB or not. Reasonable price. Go for it.
"Good mobile with pure android, slightly gets heated up & battery drains little quicker"
Screen to body ratio is good... The product is very handy... The camera is pretty ok not the best... Performance is really well.... Battery life is manageable... Heavy usage is not much possible in a 3000mah battery... Overall pretty ok smartphone
Nokia is most underrated company.. this is brilliant phone.. elegant design and easy to use... Far better than pure China companies like oppo and vivo....
"Camera is not as per expectations, but overall performance wise:-- **"""""" NOKIA IS BACK AGAIN WITH REJUVENATIVE FORM"""""""
1-Bad listing experience in headphones (not in provided headphones) either i am using good quality headphones
2- camera quality very Baad
3 - No sound effects
4- there are Dolby Atmos in Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 but there are nothing
"Charging cable is very hard, problem may be occurs during charging, when change the position of phone. Cable should be soft ."
Fingertip reader is little slow. Battery life is good. Runs on stock Android
It needs an update before we start the phone
Everything is good but since yesterday night I am experiencing screen blankout n my phone stopped working in the same month of purchase.
Worst experience
Overall Not satisfactory
Battery below average
Camera below average
Fingerprint average
Speaker very bad like old chinese phone
"don't buy Nokia phones because the quality of display , touch, performance are very bad. once you buy it after some day you fill worth less."
Overall a very good product..feels premium in class..
*screen  is best in the price range..good colour saturation
*Camera is good in daylight
* Battery runs smoothly for the day long
Excellent product of Nokia. Nokia 6.1 plus is a very good phone with awesome camera and excellent sound quality. The screen and notch is very good. The fingerprint is good and battery is also good. I am fully satisfied with this product.
Software doesn't work properly
Nokia 6.1 plus is a class mobile.
But i buy from EMI options... It's a big mistake for me.. Because Rs. 3299.70 is my monthly installment for 3 month.But Amazon charge me Rs.6721. First installment. It's very horrible...
seems nice.
but be aware of glass the back. easily breakable and slippery.
I like the product in the range and bran Nokia is focusing on product and ready to compite chaneese product in the market...
Touch & fingerprint reader works faster.. camera looks good but didn't explore much
Everything is good except front camera disaster and dept effects worse
Online shopping system or rate is good but major problem is miss matching the mobile glass screen I purchased mobile and mobile screen protector but screen protector is bigger than mobile please advise and try to solve the problem.
Software update taken long time when I connect wi fi high-speed still Display waiting for Wi-Fi connection
"Continuing Nokia Flagship - Easy to Operate, Handy, 6GB RAM works smooth"
This is very poor items .
Buy it  do not confused very good phone
"Camara having a good quality,but in case of low light photography we'll get only a below average result.Design is top level,the worst thing is battery life.Cant expect much more capacity from 3060mah battery"
I knew that all Nokia phones have charging issues but this phone is charging slow as turtle out of the box
"Good phone for this price, but camera and battery life needs some upgrade very poor battery life"
You wont get better spec phone like this.. 6 gb ram & with nokia brand believe... its awesome.....
It's good but not that Great... Camera is very poor
This is pathetic product introduced by Nokia. Price is aggressive but call and camera quality is very poor. I will never recommend this product to anyone. Better spend few more rupees and opt for another brand.
Good phone on this budget. Overall it's good experience
Nice one....nokia back in action.....6+64 gb
"The build quality, the touch sense and the camera imaging quality are top notch... Great product at a good price."
Nokia is back to the market. Hope they release more of such great devices.
The touch is very bad and it hangs i need to return this please refund and return my money. I do not see return option. Its not working well and not been a month also? Just two weeks and i am facing trouble. Please help
Nokia best phone @this Price with hardware specifications
Charging is the best part
Very bad
Excellent build quality. Great Display.The phone is lagging a bit even with 6 GB RAM. PUBG runs with medium graphics. Phone Dialer and recent apps always lag .Camera is average. Fingerprint sensor is slow.
"Not good at performance as expected. Volume is not good, Camera quality is not good, phone started misbehaving post 7days usage and with weird kind of issues."
Charging port problem very bad Nokia product I hate Nokia
Nice budget phone with good power back-up.. genuine product from Amazon
A very good phone in the budget.
Only 2 cons
Low battery life( will last one whole day tho)
Touch screen is not smooth enough and sometimes fails to detect four finger claw!(pubg lovers will know)
"I like always Nokia  and also will be like forever,"

Charging was going down vert quickly
"Fast, good battery, awesome screen quality. Camera not good, finger print is slow but I can manage it. Overall I am impressed by NOKIA."
Good in performance as the Ram is 6GB. Worth the money for purchasing. Camera quality could have being improved.. Still a long way to catchup with Samsung other products of same range

Invalid sim tool kit problem..
Very bad experience in amazon
Awesome product with awesome features on wonderful price.  Love this phone...

"Its a nice buy for this price. Nokia still a go to brand, with such great camera and battery lasts for a day"
"very good quality , good features , good speed"
"I have purhased this phone from a different platform, but I like to share the following facts about this sophisticated device.There is a negative publicity about this device even though this happens to be the BEST MOBILE PHONE in the range of Rs.10,000  - Rs.14,000."
"I am using it for the last six months and I must admit that the photographs taken are mediocre, and the charging port has some issues.However if you can compromise with picture quality and buy a separate charger for the device by paying Rs.250 from the nokia store you can actually enjoy brilliance of this phone."
"PUBG plays reasonably well in this phone and the battery backup is definitely better than the Chinese counterparts.NOKIA NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHARGER IN THIS DEVICE , OTHERWISE THIS PHONE IS A SPECTACULAR MACHINE WITH 6 gb ram , stylistic looks and pure stock Android."
 OVERALL THIS IS A VERY GOOD PHONE.
"Useless product. Bought it in December 2018. The very next day I bought it had to go to the Nokia service station as the 2nd sim slot was not working. The service centre refused to replace the device even though there was no fault of mine. Later after 1 month speaker stopped working. After 7 months the charger stopped working. As it was out of warranty had to pay for it. After 8 months 2nd sim slot again stopped working and now the mobile charging slot is also not working. Absolute waste of ₹ 17,000."
Bought Nokia as thought quality is good. After this never in my life will buy a Nokia or recommend it.
Fingers print reader - well
Battery life- not satisfactory
Value of money - not bad in that price
Camera quality- good but not satisfactory
Just ok in mid-average price
Having notch display FHD
But trustable brand nokia so ok in that price
Its been 10 month's of usage brought it lastyear for Diwali...within six months the charger cable stopped working...laterthe chaging usb socke in phone and hardly got any service centers...poor picture quality ...totally not worth a buy...
Don't buy nokia 6.1 plus before searching nokia 6.1plus charging issue on you tube because I purchased  nokia 7 plus and had to replace charging port twise within 14 months. Then i got to know that other nokia phones have same issue. And service centre peoples in nokia stores are stupid monkeys
"Being a Nokia fanboy, I waited for this phone for almost 6 months and bought it on the first day of launch."
"Within 3 months, Charging Port of the phone has stopped working properly. Nokia forums are filled with complaints regarding the same and customer service is worst. They are not ready to accept that its a manufacturing fault and asking for hefty price for replacement even during warranty period."
Very bad phone no one should buy. If you want perfect review please vist to customer care centre you will get prefect review stand and see how many customers are coming for this phone. Phone have build in problem with charging jack. Almost 98% phone have this issue.
"If anyone having solution for new nokia 6.1 plus model software error , please share. i purchase phone and within week the downoad now error shows in this phone, when i visit Nokia care revert it will take one month to repair, i go to gaffar market 100's of phone unrepairable avaible in market for same model...."
Beware of NOKIA 6.1 PLUS...... Contact me on 8474910076...
The back side glass is too sensitive...it breaks very easily...after 6 months of purchase battery slot problem arises....I've been phasing this from problem from few months....the only problem with this mobile is battery slot....this sucks literally!
The battery life of this phone is highly unacceptable. The phone we received loses charge by almost 15% on stand-by mode during the night when there is no activity on the phone. This is despite it being connected to a full time Wifi device and not on to a Mobile network. Really unhappy with this phone.
"I wouldn't suggest to buy this, rather go for Moto E, which is cheaper and more powerful."
"I got it yesterday, today I started using, software update took some time but that's ok, what I am unhappy on this mobile is camera quality, very poor, and front camera is not working, two lines are displaying in camera view and the lines are appears after the picture is taken, I can see lines in the picture, so I am returning now, not sure if I can recommend or not, but totally unhappy 😚"
Worst phone seen in my life
Charging problem
Hang problem
Black dot in camera
Ringtone problem
I have service center and still my problem is not solved
Charger quality is poor
"First major problems- Airtel 4g not properly supported, customer care always say get sim changed."
"Second major problem- charging port get damage within a span of 3-5months, even Nokia accepted this."
"Customer care not responsible, just want to make money unnecessary."
Worst phone i ever purchased. Phone charging port got out of order for two times within 10 month of purchase.
"It's just the best phone the money you spend for. Have been using for a year now. Still the same as, when it was bought. The feel that this phone has, is just amazing. Don't know why so many negative reviews."
"This phone is good , just a single problem of charging point , which make this phone a crap ."
"It has a manufacturing defect of charging point , you can search about this in google ,"
"Just don't buy , thank me later :)"
Best phone under 12k go for it.its 6 gb ram variant and antutu benchmark is something 1 lakh it is low score when you compare to 4 gb variant thats why the 6gb ram has low price conpare to 4 gb
Gets heated faster it may blast be care full. Guaranty or warranty which the company gives can not be claimed. There is no response from the company if there is any damage to the software or product.
Good
Product is very good but received the defective piece the screen has dead pixelsbe tried to exchange  the product but Amazon is not responding very bad service from Amazon.😠😠😠😠😤
It is ok not very big size not very small.Dont know performance of camera & battery.
Better than cheap Chinese phones...
Camera realy Nice.
Finger - Fast
Chaging - Fast
Quality - Good
Gaming experience - Good
All most Good.
Value for money...
"Nokia ka Bharosa, Better product when compared with other brand - Sound is good, quality is good. Can think of buying at this price again"
This phone had problems from day one.
Biggest issue is charging.
LIKE
Worst phone that i have ever purchased
Every month i have to go care and replace or repair due to charging issues
Value for money
"My phone was defected, the touch on the upper part was unresponsive."
Bad Customer support.
Low battery capacity
Wastage of money.. both front and back panels are fragile. The phone fell from chair and both front and back panels broken.
Actually net is lagging
And camera is not up to mark
Phn is different
"Great quality product from the house of Nokia mobile. Great build quality, beautiful mobile phone works perfectly."
"Worst phone, dont buy, charging issues, my mobile in under warranty but the service team not responding"
Phone has great battery life and it run smoothly
Good
Camera quality is very low
Not like old Nokia but phones
Good in the budget
Charging slots is very low quality / service is also very poor
Very bad phone with lot of problems regarding charging port
Price  ..high
Good phone. Wanted to buy it from a very long time
Compact Design. Fingerprint Sensor very Fast responsive.
Awesome.phn
"According cost and features , phone is best."
Charging slot problem every 2 months
Good brand and very happy with the purchase
Not fast charging
Good loking only
Worst
Grand is Grand.Solid Phone
The function s are so good
Camera quality very good
It is a bed product
Excellent phone
Hanging problem
Battery life
WoW
Good mobile
Pure Android experience. Solid build quality. Best Ergonomics and compact phone.. Value for money product under 12k..
"Very good mobile in 12k , nice performance with one day battery capacity with using multiple applications, but if idle then two days no worry, new C type charging cable required."
"This review is for the seller. I was very much impressed with the 4gb version which I am using for last 8 months and bought this 6gb version on sale during prime day sale. I was little hesistant becoz the competing market place did not reduce the price for 6gb version and was selling the 4gb version at a price higher than this , still I went ahead and bought this and my fear came true partially."
Below are the problems I faced :
"1) packaging was bad..box was crushed in many areas when I received , dirt on product box and did not look like a fresh one"
2) some minor scratches or some wear and tear on left bottom corner of the phone which I tried cleaning with phone cleaner liquid ..it is ok now to some extent...but again did not get a good fresh new product feeling..
"3) 4g connection is inconsistent , this may be due to service provider too but the same model 4g version phone which has good data connection speed at my home ..but this one is struggling ..like 2g speed at home..but it gave good download speed in other areas...similarly I installed Google cam on 4g version and worked really well but it crashes on this 6gb version in 'camera' mode and works fine on other modes. I don't know how to find a solution for these weird problems.."
Overall my doubt on the discount is partially proved right..some things are not as good as the real Nokia 6.1 plus..
"Not a good one, cumbersome activities"
"Very much different from other Android mobiles, not as expected of Nokia phones"
After using it for 10 Days i am writing a  honest review :
Pros :
1. Its not Bulky. Has a small and sleek desing easy to carry and yet so powerfull due to Snapdragon 636 Chipset and 6 GB Ram.
2. Premium Body and feels like you are holding an IPhone.
3. Screen resolution.
"4. Pure Android Experince , dosen't have any customised UI or App which later slowdown the phone (Had an experience on MI Note4)"
5. Type-C and 3.5 mm Jack both are present.
6. Battery is OK.
7. Charges quickly .
"8. If your basic need is Phone calling , Listening Music , Watching Movies / Web series. This is the best option."
"9. Selfie Camera is great , with multiple functions readily available."
Cons :
1. Camera is not that Great its OK.
"2. If you play high end games , it heats up but it doesn't lags."
3. Playing up High end Games drains the battery quickly.
4.Battery charges only if you have a good quality of Type -C cable.
"5. To Listen Music / to watch a video file you need to install an app , no in-build application. (Would recommeded Pi Music Playe and MX Player)."
"Overall I think it was a good buy for me as Amazon offered it for 10999/- Rs. and was looking for Small and powerfull phone with good RAM (6 Gb) , CPU( Qualcomm , Snapdragon 636)  and internal memory (64 Gb , Usable 52 Gb). Overall i am satisfied with my purchase."
Pros- Looks great. Very premium
Fast software and security updates
Stock Android
Camera is decent. Can get some amazing shots. Low light could be better.
AR available
Screen pretty great indoors. Outside is average.
Good battery for moderate use 5-6 hours on screen.
Charging speeds also good.
HEADPHONE JACK PORT
Cons-
No NFC
... i know for the price its great. i really dont have any issues with it for the past 8 months. no lags but ocassional stutter when many apps in the background. but thats rare. worth the money for daily driver for medium users.
I am writting this after a few days of use...
I only use this phone for office purpose....but the main thing is battery....just 3000....and it seems after update battery drains faster....so if I keep my data on and taking calls and frequently using social apps to reply...and keep on doing other office work....then battery is good for just 7hrs....and that's not great....it would have been much better if I had thought about this before I bought this....if I have to go official trip then I have to take power bank with me....and this wasn't the issue with my other red mi phones.... because the batter was 4000...other than this issue...camera is Great...looks is amazing...phone is sturdy... believe me because accidentally it fell flat from 6feet on road...and nothing happened to it...so its strong as rock.... performance is smooth like butter handles many apps without any drag...but at this prize I should have thought about battery performance before buying this...but I am not regretting but a little disappointed....
"So, if you are an extensive user of internet then you really don't want to buy this one else this a good piece."
Poor Ringtone volume.  You kinda almost miss the incoming calls. However voice quality seems to be Good.
"Screen is not cozy!  If you are a first time Smartphone User then cool! Else, damn sure you dislike it!"
CAM Quality is just OKay!  At least Not worse!
"So far OS, Processor and Performance is concerned, its Good.  Response is quicker and unlike lenovo it does not hang up often.  Phone might heat up if you constantly watch youtube videos."
"Reviewing it after using more than 15 days. I'm very much satisfied with battery, camera and phone performance. Multitasking and switching between the apps works seemlesly. Stock Android 9 rocks. No extra app to worry."
"Very easy to use single handed. Initially it looks me very slippery, since I used to have earlier phone with back cover. But now I'm used to. Though, in initial days you are very much concern about the scratches."
Glass body gives a premium look.
"Nokia is a real smart phone, other smartphone forget to concentrate on the basics of mobile, like signal strength, battery, using the phone under the sun light, etc.,...Was waiting  for It for a long time."
Performance is very poor.... Very slow.... Even 2GB RAM is far better than this. I have Nokia 5.1plus. Based on that performance I have chosen this.... 5.1plus is far better than this product .. lost faith on Nokia. No reply for replacement by Amazon is worse than this
"In my experience, Mi 5 was the best phone ever - Nokia 6.1 Plus comes closest to matching it, right down to the slick glass back. The day I bought it, I dropped it twice on the floor screen first, causing some minor scratches. I suggest buying a cover and screen guard to avoid my mistakes."
"Otherwise, it is quite good."
"At 11k It's Best Phone,With Premium Build Quality,And Excellent Performance, I've Purchased 6/64 Gb Variant And It's Performing Flawlessly, I'm Using Mi Usb Type C Cable To Be On The Safer Side Haven't Face Any Issues Till Now And Bope Will Never Face Any In Future Aswell In Sha Allah"
OverAll 10/10
"This mobile is excellent  mobile  as per price. The size of mobile is very very good. Everything is fine except camera, i will give camera 3/5 points, otherwise this mobile is awesome"
"Good, but few performance issues"
"I love this mobile, It's very thin and beautiful."
Super camera quality
Battery lasts one day of moderate use.
Nokia sending security updates every month. That's great.
Got Pie Update. My NOKIA 6.1 plus running smoothly.
Thanks Nokia.!!
Everything is very good except battery and camera. Battery is ok ok but camera is worst. We can't take picture in low light. Now a days everybody is buying phone for camera and I m disappointed with this phone due to the camera.
"Overall phone is good , camara is average but not bad , performance is good , build quality is amazing"
"Very good phone for a decent price. After using it for 4 days now, I can say there are no lags at all. Apps work smooth. Also Android version is updated to 9.0 Pie with latest security patch. Overall good experience."
Got phone in 10K.
Value for money phone with Premium build quality
And Stunning camera in this range.
Yes some phone also in 10k range but you want premium look and handy phone go for it.
It is very good mobile with no lag. Camera pics are very sharp but low light aur dark shots are above average. But mobile is very good for students. Its great deal with good brand and quality.
"At this price, premium looks.easy to operate with single hand.camera is average.got it in 12k,6gb version."
"Battery is little less, every thing else is seamless"
"Very fast charging, good camera , good ram and speed , good network capabilities, always catch double signal than myvi-phone 7 at same  place with same network"
"Worst mobile.. Only single Sim.. If u want to keep 2nd Sim, need to remove mmc.. Chichi"
"Nice camera and portrait  mode also very fast fingerprint reader, this phone only buy for basic use like call, photo, or web surfing for best. Not for gaming  purpose thanks nokia..."
"Loved it.. it has got premium , glossy look. Display is good. It's slim and quite light in weight. Camera quality is very good. Overall it's a good buy.."
Phone looks premium. But feels like it’s very delicate. Works efficiently as of now.
"Very good looking,build quality superb.6 GB ram . white colour."
"Average camera, battery not so good, very slippery.can can't use without cover."
This phone is horrible. It becomes heated up very quickly while talking for just about 5mins. Battery back up is not good.
Would like to return this product
Never fails to retain the loyalty
"Edit - However, Vodafone UP (E) will not support 4G LTE despite upgrade, Reliance JIO will"
"Very Good Product at these price range and even better than compare to other on these range ! can't even imagine 6 GB RAM , Grt"
"Shop price is Rs14500. Online offer at this rate is attractive. Display., memory, camera all are plus points. But if you are looking for a large screen mobile go for some other model."
"The service was excellent. And it's worth buying. The product is really good for this price, Rs.10999. Thanks to Amazon for this deal."
Display issues. Has dots on screen which can only be visible when you click a total black picture. Okayish phone not  the best choice.
We really loved it.
Overall I wasted 11000 rupees
Nokia will never can be better than a Chinese mobile phone brand
Best in size...i am using from last 10 months and purchased another for uncle... great phone in budget..
"bought cos of offered discount, but compared to huawei features are less n battery isn't so good."
"Great phone in terms of design, performance, battery life but the only that lacks it behind from its competitors is its camera in low light camera quality is very bad but overall it has fine cameras."
Good one.
No complains.
"Value for money. Got in INR 11,500/-"
64GB model.
I like the fichers of the product. But Nokia can improve its battery quality. Amazon can improve selling trust by providing genuine thing given to consumers. Because some time they ordered genuine products but real products faced some problems.
It's one of the better phone from all hyped other phones .. best value for money ... very much premium looks with feel good factor in holding ... in time delivery & perfect packing ..
Nokia is back
"Quality product with Artificial intelligence. Except battery use, the mobile is too good."
It's one of the best phone from house is Nokia. Don't compare it with Chinese mobile manufactures
Phone is not booting completely.
"Excellent no hang issues, very good performance, good enough picture quality. Value for money."
Very nice product... Hoping it works longer...
Nice but battery backup is worried
One of the best phone in this price range.
Beautiful looking and easy one hand use
Excellent value for money
very good i am happy.
Amazon good sales
Value for money without any doubt.
Very good phone with no crap installed.
Battery sucks not even one day it's last after full charge.
Worth it's cost
Very impressive phone feeling like Iphone x
Good in budget
Except Battery everything in the Phone is awesome great looks ...
Everything fine.. and it's too nice..
Very good phone
Excellent mobile
Works great!
"Very bad, sensors are not good, touch havy pressure then active. Also heating."
"Delivery on time, worth for price we spent. Camera is very good."
Great phone at this price.
OK ok phone no issue
Good
Decent specs.
Good product value for money
Good product
Small battry
Less camera quality and good battery life
Display and fingerprint problem
Nothing to tell again
Took this mobile before 8 month and now the charging port is not working.
"i am still struggling to get my refund back, can't review phone as it wasn't working"
Poor battery life
Most useless mobile
behind in so maney things
all is well
Great stuff value for money
This Nokia mobile is very good. Recommend others.
Phone is used for talking and the funniest part is you can hear what other is talking through this phone. Total cheat on your money
"Nokia with Android one didn't rise upto the expectations. Brought it after accepting it to be an average camera, thinking 6gb in Android one OS gonna cover the negatives. But, with crashes and lags being frequent, no area left to point out the handset being worth for the purchase.Never recommend to anyone, even for a beginner"
Nice
Worst product
Fabulous product from Nokia value for money
Camera is good but clerity not defind
Everything is ok but special lock system is just pathetic
Charging problem
"Android one is good platform, look was feel outstanding,& good Bild quality, camera working time a little heating problem, selfie cam is good, back cam poor quality, over use little heating problem, network very good ,"
" Battery is good, slow motion video very very bad, display perfect quality,"
Nothing more I'm feel like this device.... ( 10/7)
Second sim slot not working
over heating
It's absolutely nice .
"How to check for this mobile having 4GB or 6GB, because I has purchased 6GB , Nokia 6.1 plus & I was checked that settings as well as not mentioned on box , plz guide to me"
Good nokia
Very poor feel very bad to say I buy on sept 4 after some days my display became bad
"Ultimate product of Nokia, having 6GB RAM and quick access fingerprint."
Please improve the Battery capacity...
"The worst part is battery, you must charge it twice a day if you are gaming or watching movies."
Speakers at bottom is not up to the mark.
Remaining everything is pretty standard.
Best mobile best price best seller
Dead pixels and white spots on screen. This seller must be selling rejected devices
Everything is perfect
Touch is not working well
Plz change my phone
"6.1 plus with 6GB is the cheapest available device in its category. More it becomes cheaper, more chances of defects. Just imagine, WHY IS IT NOT CHEAPER ELSEWHERE?"
Display
I like it's performance but it's screen lock is not working
Camera could have been better :-(
"I like only the name of NOKIA for that reason I bought this I had faced some problem with first order , finely amazon helped lot thanks amazon for your immediate reaction"
It’s so nice
I am here to write a 5 day review..not at all happy with Nokia this time..I am a big time fan for nokia. But touch screen disappointed me very much..it always stucksvand take the actions on it's own..poor quality touch..sucks man
Overall Good Product but not the Best
I hate the battery backup of this phone
It is working in good condition.
Good quality camera and fingerprint the battery also superbvvvv....under fifteen thousand in Nokia android 9 version well...... Nokia always maintained quality....
Nice product
I purchased this mobile today it was simply superb. The phone was launched 10 months before but it steals the show even today.
Now it's the right time to buy this phone for 11k 6gb variant. I choosed the white colour piece it was fantastic to see.
Awesome awesome awesome awesome
Pls don't buy beacuse it heats too much faster and battery life is less and battery is bad
good
"After one month use, phone started problem. Screen of phone started moving up and down and apps started itself. We are 3 friend ordered phone in aug'2019 sale and every one is facing problems in their phones."
Very bad product.
Good phone but battery is little small
Very good phone..very hand and easy to use..value for money..
"after searching for phones finally, I got a handy phone which I liked! Thank you @amazon!"
Good smartphone... value for money..fast.. camera quality is average.... overall very good
"Hello everyone, First of all I would like to thank Amazon for delivering such a wonderful and cost effective phone on time. I am using iPhone since 2010 and this is my first attempt to try a different brand. Two phones cames to my mind Moto and Nokia. I chose Nokia and bought 6.1 with 64 GB memory and 6 GB ram. The experience is wonderful, such an awesome devise with beautiful look, very fast, cool battery life nice camera with a cost of 11K. Guys if we are comparing this phone with any other chinese phone, this is such an amazing phone. You must buy it, you will experience the difference and the technology of our grandpa Nokia."
Great Phone
Very nice mobile every thing is perfect
This is my honest review.
The phone is massive in memory for this price range. And the performance is so far good after I used for two days. The phone is so handy and fits in the hand. Need to put a cover to have a better grip as sides are a bit slippery.
The worst thing I hate about this phone is the battery. I’m really disappointed with the battery. Looking into the battery stats from the phone. My last charge shows 20 hours before and my screen on time is 2 hours and 40 mins and my phone has reached 39%. I hardly used the phone. Just basic things.
Camera and fingerprint is so good but battery life is not so good
"Superb ""Noise Cancellation"" and ""Display"". Performance is awesome, no lags at all. Design is perfect, specially the glass back...wow!. Camera could have been a bit better. Waiting for some camera related updates..."
Good samt mobile
Super....
Phone is good but not so good
Not bad
Worst product bed quality of camera and I bought this product before 1 week and now there is a problem of call speaker not working.enable to pick call without on the speaker.
Worth the price. Specs are commentable. 6gb ram  and a snapdragon 636 processor makes the gaming experience quite good. Good build quality. Camera is above average. Google cam is much better than stock cam. Batterylife could have been better by using a battery of higher amph capacity. Still a good buy for this price range.
Good
"charging is not working, its waste"
Good
Everything fine except battery life.
No NFC. Some issue with voice call speaker.
"Phone build quality is excellent, display is superb, overall very good phone in this budget, RAM not able to figure out how much consumed and how much available, delivered on time this time thanks to Amazon, touch is moderate, smooth at middle of screen only."
 camera yet to be tested.
"Phone seems to be refurbished, not first-hand. Gum can be easily seen at the edge of display glass."
Nice phone
"Like -look, size ,price, ram, speed performance and light wait."
Dislike -battery life 🔋 worst experience if possible I'll like to change bcz i feel battery draining too fast maybe this issue with particular my device. If anyone already buy plz share ur opinion on battery life plz.
Good product
Slim and back look is fantastic....and good process....
its worst phone ever. dont buy this phone
Good quality phone in less price
👍
"This is 2nd same model mobile I bought it for my family member, after use of 1st phone for 1year."
Even I have Nokia 7 plus since more than 1 year.
"Both are having good build, Android OS buttery smooth, every month security updates without miss."
Really Nokia is the one I prefer for anyone.
worst product.. wastage of money.. touch button does nt work properly .every time u hv to compromise.
i bought it due to its small size..bt it disappointed me.
Very good and value for money
"This mobile have charging port issue, the service center not maintaining the stock, don't buy this product."
Good phone at this price
Nice phone but during night or dark time no clarity in picture
Working fine
Very bad product delivered.. after 15 days I have to repair this phone from care center..
Product hangs and crashes
I had buy this phone due to good looking and  Singal handed operation because it's small size but camera quality is not upto mark. Battery backup is so weak.
Gud product
"Android One phone +  6GB RAM + price of 10,999 + brand name of Nokia + several other features - I would not think twice to go for it."
Very happy with the purchase so far.  Definitely worth the money.
WELCOME BACK NOKIA....
Super
Dead
Nice
Still refund not initiated and I didn't get money. Mble is worst
Microphone isse
Very satisfied
Erratic behaviour. Screen operates at its own whim. There is no system to receive a call when you are using the phone.
Good....
I love nokia
Good
Display faults within couple of months. Horrible after sales.
"It is beautiful, awesome and butter smooth. Only problem is battery which drains very fast."
Damaged mobile received.
Little bit of heating issues during charging.
Everything is perfect
I like Nokia
After a long time I hv got a great mobile. I feel proud to have Nokia 6.1 plus in my hand. Really it is diffrent than other brands.
"manufactoring defective product sold to me, exactly after 14 days, phone is not getting charged, not sure, the issue with NOKIA 6.1 PLUS Phone or C Type cable."
Item not as advertised.. Received 4gb ram phone instead of 6gb ram phone.
Unable to trace the RAM details in phone however when IMEI checked found its 2018 model and 4gb ram phone.
People who are technically weak might not able to find out.
Worst battery capacity
performance is good but the battery drain very fast
Superb mobile for this price range good
Sai h phn is budget me
Ok types
"Camera quality good ,Night ke lie utni achhi nhi hai,battery good performance"

Highly satisfied
A complete smart phone has low weight and good speed. Everything superb. Cute and quality design and well. Finished product . Built quality is good tgsn iphones and all other chinees phones. This one is made in India .
Nice product value for money
Super quality is good
Mobile is very light weight and smooth experience
Got something extra as expected with the feeling of having latest smartphone
"It look good , fast, battery life is little low , slow-mo feature is better than other phones."
 PUBG graphics is good..
Awesome
All future are good
Hangs often while turning on the data. Otherwise worthy phone for the price.
Its good at this price
"Touch, processor and Handy Phone"
It's a public product. Awesome bat life. Very responsive fp. Clear audio. Only idle people requires camera.
Very good
Awesome phone... Very fast..
"This phone is not upto mark as per todays standards. Camera,performance,touch,screen resolution and other features not upto mark. This phone i will prefer if nokia launched this phone 7-8 years before."
Good as per specs
Product is very good .one must buy this phone.vale for money and have many features .people usually  dont buy this phone because of the name of comapany i.e nokia  but beleive me this is the best product .i love this product  the quality of camera was so good
good
Well the phone is very good looking. Solid build quality. Smooth performance with 6gb ram and SD 636. But the headset given in the box looks very cheap. Didn't expect this from Nokia.
Low Price with Powerful Battery Performance  and ram
Price value phone but phone heating and voice problem.
"Many Friends of Mine having issue after buying Nokia Phones, Most of the time problem is with screen. One of my friend having issue of blur screen at right side of screen in less then one month, Service center guys told this is due to bending and not covered in warranty. But Bend never happened. Service center guys just make fake excuse."
"I have been finding a phone with quality features and got NOKIA 6.1 plus.This is the best economical phone for me till date.Everthing is good-the built quality,the fingerprint reader,camera quality.The battery was expected to be a little more but that's fine.It is a smooth and fast phone."
I have purchased this product but microfone is not working. I have installed software it's showing all ok. Need to replace the same
 Enjoying!!
"Mobile looking is very good.but camera is not so good,"
liked the phone
Screen spot
Nice
Using Nokia after a decade and to my surprise it gives immense pleasure in using this mobile. Go for it.....value for money
The hardware is really good but display can be made little bigger
Awsome
Nokia brand I personally like it since long ...camera quality is good
Very wrost mobile ever in my life
Best in law budget
The Quality of the phone is great .it gives u premium look. Value for money phone. Battery backup may not be enough for gamers. Every thing else is awesome.. Nokia is in a league of its own.
Sensitivity of touch is so nice
Speaker dead
I have been using it from one year and this phone does it performance best of it and really very good.
Camera quality is good. Music is really awesome and i found the difference among multiple smart phones.... the way the music effect it throws is awesome !!.. It has its own standard in music delivery !!!
Handling is easy in single palm.... Look wise .. pretty royal look... overall  worth for the money....
I am going again for the same model for 6GB RAM..... Stunning model !!
"The worst out their , the guy want helping in retiring the product in just a week I got a charging problem"
Shape and size of this mobile is great. Camera quality and battery life is less than average. Charger quality is very very poor.
Pros:
Solid build
Android One
Reasonable battery life
Value for money
Good screensize - compact enough for single hand operation
Cons:
"Pathetic camera, particularly in low light conditions"
"Despite Android One security, some adware found its way into my phone. Only a reset resolved the issue"
worst phone i have use so far. charging jack damaging repeatably. .
i had buy this phone and writing this review after almost a month started problem in ear low quality of product not to buy suggest friends not to buy nokia 6.1
Mic does not work. Need to take call on speaker or with headphones
While  taking to someone the voice is not coming and going properly .
Nokia had came up with great product at this price with 6GB Ram and 64GB storage area. And above better than Chinese products.
Camera is not up to the mark... Sometimes touch screen is not working.... other wise it's ok....
Not good
Mobile is fully good but it's battery back up is not good and unsatisfy
Nothing to dislike 😉
"Lots of plus ..... UI , desine , comfy in hand display and on and on ..... Only prblm is battery .... Lasts a day comfortable 2 for me as I am not a heavy user and fast charging helps ... More than perfect phone for me ..... Whish they had provided fast charger instead of normal one .... But it still charges 35% in 30 min"
Ohhh soo sooo great phone in such a less price I freakishly love it
It is good one
"Very nice Mobil,"
Good
"Last year at first sale i purchased the phone with 4GB RAM 64GN storage Black edition, somehow lost within a month."
Even after looking at market with year long wait still able find this phone reliable with good specs and within budget.
"Purchased once again within 10000 budget 6GB, 64 GB Black, within 2 month of use, battery and software performance are excellent if you use phone for daily use without too much of video or gaming the battery will last for 2 days !!!"
- Front camera improved a lot in terms of last year performance
"- Software are update with latest OS, hope they will provide us for latest purchase user for next 2 Years."
"If you professional than go for it, best phone with nice sleek design and performance withing budget and lucky if you purchase in amazon deal like i do in recent purchase."
Mobile is good as per comparative price
Nice
Amazon looting the people by giving damage product.  And the technician who comes for inspection  is bit ready to here out problems  .he is simply closing the complant by telling its resolved ..
Need to take action  on this looters.
And this phone is worst no battery life . Its becoming  full hot while charging..
Sound is not clear..
This looters..are worst
Camera quality is't good at low light . Battery too drains fast. Otherwise satisfied with it.
"Over all good phone. Mid range phone, on bank offer is good to buy"
"working good after usage of more then a month, carema beats all xiaomi devices which comes in this price range and only night photos is not actually good in outdoor conditions and more importantly Nokia mobiles gets updates faster than any other manufacturers, that is very good thing"
Battery is bad quality
Nice budget phone
"Handy and good user interface, operating speed and look."
The mobile u delivered was defective and heating problem. Continue trying for replace but u r showing troubleshooting option. Want to replace before 18 Sep. But due to ur option can't able to replace. Worst experience
Loved the device. It has stock android so there is no lag in the OS. Phone feels premium in hand but i do recommend a cover for protection. Pubg mobile runs at low settings but with no lag so no issue. Camera quality is great for the price point.
No face cam unlock
Worst mobile phone
Value for money
"Product in this rate is average. Camera is not that much promising ,good in good light, day times. Front camera is not good. The promising night HDR effect and all utterly nonsense. Charge drains so soon. It will take too much time to get fully charged. The offering 6gb ram because it doesn't have most of the common inbuilt apps like gallery, music player. And it has a heating issue too.. phone will get heat soon. Look is classy , usable with one hand."
There are so many mobile phones in the market but I preferred 6.1 plus just because it's performance. I am very much satisfied with the product
Bad. Hangs all the time.
I have charge the battery 1 hr.before 80%then become after 1 hr. Become 48% but his new cell na
Very good
Overall satisfaction bin all respect. This is my second purchase of Nokia 6.1 plus at my home
Selfie not good
"Camera is good, does not have recording feature. Battery drains faster. Overall worth the price."
Vgy
To restart with Nokia looks great. Hope the mobile stays healthy in future also. Overall good handset.
Nice product
Maximum features in this price but camera quality is not so good.
WORKING CONDITION & CAM  LOOKING SMART
"Looks and feels Solid. Built well, battery is very good. Only 2 minor complaints on camera it could have been better, call audio could have been a little higher."
Otherwise a solid phone for the price point
value of money
"I am using Nokia 5.1 plus phone since past 10 months which is similar to this phone, the phone is average. It has major factory manufacturing defect."
"The charging port or charging pad starts malfunctioning after few months. If you wish to get it repaired in warranty period, they will submit your device and won't repair till a month or two as there is shortage of this part. Also, some service center will ask for money saying the water damage. So, service is pathetic. It doesn't support any other charging PCB as it contains network IC. So, it seems the major maufacturing defect and poor comapany response in warranty period.  I recommend not to buy any Nokia product.  Old Nokia was different. This Nokia have not such quality."
Nokia is still alive.
"Worst phone, touch is VERY hard, need refund."
Good product
Ok for the value paid
Value for money.
Good
"We expect good camera quality, in night we use flash , we saw light in eyes that is waste of all efforts , please do some software changes to resolve the issue."
I am not satisfy Amazon service and mobile quality my phone issue not resolve...
FRONT CAMERA NOT QUALTY VIDEO CALLING NOT PROPER SHOW
"Phone is very good, but battery backup is not well."
Third class mobile
Nokia 6.1 plus
Battery life network issues heating problems
Or we can say bunch of problems
Gud_quality_smartphone
Stock_android
"Nokia 6.1 is stylish, but it quality is pathetic. Charging port issue is very common. Just Google it before buying"
Sound quality is very poor. I have Nokia 5 Plus and it is far.better than Nokia 6.0 plus. Sensing quality is also very poor. Made a blunder in my life. Taken on 23 July this year. How to replace or how to set right only God knows. Extremely unhappy.
Good
Nokia 6.1 plus mobile dead just 6 days after purchase from Amazon. Cant able to switch off or on.
Even if it requires a software update it cant be just 6 days after purchase.
Amazon policies for return or refund is not customer friendly.
"Over all, i like this phone."
"It is handy, got decent speed, decent battery life. Performance is good."
The main reason for me to choose this product was its dimensions compared to other products available in similar range.
Camera is not good as i have seen in many reviews. Especially when it comes to low light photography.
Not very easy to get proper focus & lighting.
 I'm very disappointed with this order.
It's not new product. The sealing is opened already. I'm planned to return the product.
But everything looks and works fine. If i suspect anything wrong on further usage I'm going to return the product.
Experiencing Very worst from Amazon first time.
The phone with 6gb of ram got hanged.
And i cant believe it is even possible for a new one
like
Display light emitting from the corners of the display. I purchased white colour so I think this is the drawback of only white as I don't find any gaps there but the light is passing through the frame around the display glass which is white in colour. And this time a new issue is found which is the gaps on the back side of the device at the lower edge. Poor finishing device. See pics for clear understanding.
Very good
"battery is very poor I want to replace this item, it's pulled back side fully"
"Nice & best mobile in 10, 000 price range"
Excellent
Great to use
"Nokia known for its voice quality didn't disappoint. Good buy. Screen size might be little lower when compared to other peers, but not so significant."
Hame wapas Karna h
Buill quality is good.price is too low for a 6gb ram phone
Good speed and great value for money.
very well
Worst mobile ever I got....from Nokia. It's touch stop respond after two days of use.
"OMG.....! The phone is simply awsome as expected from Nokia.. no manufacturer can give such and excellent hardware in this price range...the phone built quality is real good...ull feel like holding a premium mobile in hand ..the os,camera ,ui touch response is complete flawless...i love u use this phone .....loads of love to Nokia....."
Best phone in budget with 6 GB ram as compared to other phone and thanks to Amazon because have this phone on Flipkart as compared Amazon low in rate
Better than I expected.
Good phone at under 10K
Fingerprint reader is very swift.
Camera quality is decent
"Battery life is not great, but not very bad either. So one needs to plan to recharge end of day if heavily used."
Build quality is very good
Problem I Faced: The phone restarts by itself sometimes and sometimes gets off.  Not sure if the problem is specific to my phone or it's a known issue in this model.
Best nokia phone under this price
Good but late delivery by Amazon
"I was satisfied but you should improve packing,the box was out of shape when i received"
Camera quality is average
All okay but your prices to high
"The appearance of the product is amazing, the glossy texture of the body and the grip on the edges makes it a whole package of class and style. I personally liked it very much, and happy to get it delivered so fast."
The white one is such a pretty phone. I love the built quality looks very high end. For the price it's a great buy given its the 6gb RAM variant. I just got it today and I've downloaded 15 apps and everything is going smooth. I love Nokia and my first three bar phones were nokia. Buying the phone had a great nostalgia element for me and I find the make and use of the phone pretty much the same as all the other Nokia phones Ive ever used. First Nokia Android for me and I can only be happier I lost my iPhone three days ago and honestly I don't even miss it. I can't tell you how comforting the phone feels in my hand.
Battery back up is very poor. Cameras do not work well in low light. Fingerprint sensor takes so much time compared to other phones in this range. Battery discharges within 2 hours. I am regretting after buying this. Amazon's technician support is not good. Please don't buy this. I had not expected this from Nokia.
We want something more battery life
"Don't buy this phone because I have returned 3 phones and 4th phone is also having same microphone problem . It is not complaint about Nokia , this is about only this model"
dont buy this disguting product otherwise u will hit ur forehead in wall
Good phone. Build up quality is high
Worst product. It's battery is very weak.camera quality is not good enough to compete with other mobile devices in the same range.Finger print sensor is very slow.Mobile has heating issues.I tried to return it.But customer care passed time in sending their  engineer again and again.They passed 10 days successfully and They never returned it.
Received mobile is used one i think or refurbished because something like thread particle is stucked in between display and middle body
Super Mobile with great future in such a great discount!!!
Amber light is not working
Worst not up to mark
Good product
Its an ok product I didn't hate it nor liked it battery was not that good camera was good overall you can buy these is you want only a nokia smartphone otherwise look for some other option.
"It is defective product I get and when I chose to replacement Amazon ignore that thing ....in my Nokia 6.1 plus having 1st day giving problem battery heating , face lock not working, hang problem also, damage product also given to me ..... If Amazon will not give me replacement ...then I will never do shoping in the Amazon and also suggest to my friends and also other people not use Amazon app....Amazon you given defective item it is my request that change my mobile ...that is not small amount ..so plzz give me right product..."
Battery Life is not so long.it down fastly
Only heating problem occurs with heavy camera use. Phone looks classy & very premium. With 6GB RAM. It a best phone
Phone is good compare to others it comes with good price
Is set me battery problem h
the camera and battery are awesome.
6gb ram makes feel good
storage is also quite good
fast charger  not provided.
Great smartphone at better price with Nokia reliability... No cons...!!!
good product. value for money
Fingerprint reader is fast working very well.
Camera quantity is nice .
Mobile looks and built is up market total glass body with metal frame.
Looks very premium.
Battery life is not satisfactory at all.
I'm moderate user battery drain like anything.
"Phone is very good, with the 6gb ram every application runs flawless. Do go by the negative reviews, buy it."
Good Budget phone under 11k. Camera not good
In-Hand Feel..... Excellent and Premium
Camera..... Awesome as Expected From Nokia
Performance ...... Excellent with SD 636
Sound....Ok
UI.....Good (Stock Android)
Sim Type... Hybrid Slot (Should be Dedicated SD Slot)
Overall.... Good Phone
"Ok finger print works camera clarity ok battery also ok not bad if they provide at, least 3500 amh it"" s seems good"
"I bought this phone few days ago because of its look and some other features. However, I knew from the start that it is not the best option."
Reasons to buy-
Premium quality
Android one
RAM
I noticed after two days that the phone has a problem in screen.
"Whenever screen shuts off, you can see an RGB flash for a quarter of a second."
There are many reasons for you to not buy this phone but for me these small issues don't matter much cause I needed a better UI and look. I haven't planned to return yet.
Phone hangs
Pros:
- Good Looking
Cons:
"- Poor RAM management, dont fall in trap of 6gb RAM. Thats why here price is low"
- Too slow device
- My device have serious issues regarding hangs and i need to reboot device in order to make this work everytime.
"Amazon replacement policy is worst, not accepting my replacement by simply just running blancco test app which doesn't detect my device performance issues. Also, blanncco app shows this device has 8gb RAM, woah nice joke Amazon."
I DON'T RECOMMEND PURCHASING NOKIA 6.1 PLUS AND THAT TOO FROM AMAZON. THEIR TECHNICIAN ONCE VISITED ME AND EVEN WITHOUT TROUBLESHOOTING TOLD ME TO VISIT SERVICE CENTRE EVEN DEVICE HAS REPLACEMENT POLICY COVERED.
I REPEAT DONT GO FOR THIS device AND THAT TOO FROM AMAZON AS THEY ARE SELLING REFURBISHED PRODUCT IN THE NAME OF NEW. BASTARD AND CHEATERS BC.
Good
"Very bad phone battery life not good,camera average no any special features"
Very very very bad quality camara. Lost my money
value for money
Best phone ever with android one
This product camera not working properly and very poor in photo quality
It's very slow.And it hangs while runing some small apps...
Screen size is small
The battery life of the phone is upto 12 hours with internet or without internet. The specification of the phone is good. The quality of the phone is premium but Their is network issue in the phone from that call drop. We can't able to use the headphones for the phone because we can't remove the headphones sign and not using the phone while calling.
Camera is super & battery life is good
Safety and security measures need to be tightenup to avoid any hacking of any apps.. rest everything is fine...!
Not Nokia standards
look is very good
Very bad product
"It's just awesome if you what to use mobile for long time you can go for this and battery life is excellent , camera quality is good , mobile speed is excellent but mobile weight is  bit more overall excellent product"
This supplier phone is not working properly. Touch screen not working. Nothing is working in this phone
Poor
Fulfilled my requirements.
"Excellent phone, value for 💰, design built performance all 5 stars"
It's ok
Original and new...also nice display with battery life...worth for this price
Best android smartphone that offers timely updates
"Camera quality is not good ,same things for about  battery"
"In 10999,very budget price"
6gb of ram 64gb of rom
Nice
Good one
Awesome
Never buy a Nokia smart phone.They are poor quality screens.Touch screen will not work after 1 year.
good
All features are very good
"Amazing build quality, real men is back, baap is back.. guys this phone is must buy if you have low budget but you need all new features."
"After owning this phone you wont feel china brand quality like OPPO, VIVO, REDMI, MI OR SAMSUNG."
Good value for money
Battery life is somehow less and phone does not show information about RAM.
Worst phone
Worth for money..I bought a mobile at 11k....good product
"Best Phone up to This Price, Go for it."
It's good but there's no gallery app
Good as price and using for personal stuff!
"Voice is always disturb , Amazon checked. And replaced with other mobile and again the same problem in second mobile also . Now it's requested for return and refund ."
Rear camera is not awesome  but front is tooo good awesome phone gameing phone
Glass is too cheap it will break even fall less height
Overal performance not satisfactory
Selfie camera good. Display somewhat good. Net speed good.
" Back camera not up to expectation. Sound quality poor. Altogether not bad, that's all."
BATTERY QUALITY VERY POOR...
"Got the phone via amazon sale, Wished the money was invested wisely. The phone disconnects and restarts by itself, service center personnel dont want to touch it as its very complicated to upgrade/downgrade the software. Can be a good standby android 1 pie UI phone. Nothing great."
Awesome
Camera quality is good
Nice smart phone....
Nice phone with hmd globel
"Easy to operate , good battery back-up, value for money"
Good product as per price
Good quality mobile with sharp camera quality. Bokeh effect in the front camera is superb. Video quality is A++.
The built of the phone is sleek and the screen size is quite good.
The only disappointing factor is that the battery runs out quite soon. However the C-type Turbo charger is an A+ rated factor with which you can charge your phone upto 100% within just 1 hour.
Recommended Buy: 3.5/5
It can't  gave cashback
Good

Jhfhjgjg
Very Good Product from Nokia. 6GB Ram and 64GB is very good configuration
Overall good but camera performance is not better in low light
"Everyone talks about various features of a phone like camera , display, battery. For me the sturdiness is important and the rigidity of the old Nokia is still maintained in the new devices."
"My phone has fallen many times and without any cover still nothing happens to this phone, for me this alone qualifies for a 5 star rating."
"Build quality is excellent, battery life is good, camera quality is moderate,  worth for money. Go ahead..."
Super
"It's a good phone,very handy but i have an issue with it's camera. pictures that it captures are not good. Didn't expected that low quality from nokia. Battery backup is great. Even with about 3000mah it work very well."

Nokia was the best but now its the worst mobile to buy .. its a complete waste of money
Nice phone. I think one of the best within this range. But the charging pin is a little bit problemous. But overall the experience is beyond expectation. Nokia nailed it again. ❤❤💝
